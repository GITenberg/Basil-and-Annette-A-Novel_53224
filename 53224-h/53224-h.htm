<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_01" href="#div1Ref_01">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">In the old world the reign of winter has commenced. The woods
are snow-white, the hedges are frosted over, the pools are frozen, icicles hang
from the branches of the trees. Wayfarers walk briskly, stamp their feet, and
beat their hands to keep the circulation going; while other humans, whom
business does not call from their houses, snuggle round the fireside, with doors
and windows closed to keep out the nipping air. Winged immigrants that came in
the sweet spring days have long since taken their departure to warmer climes,
bearing with them memories of a bright youth, to be renewed when another spring
smiles upon the land.</p>

<p class="normal">In the new world, at the same moment, it is nature's holiday
time. The air is scented with the fragrance of white lilies and jessamine;
fringed violets carpet the woods; the wild passion fruit, with its gleaming
scarlet flowers, illuminates the bushes; the palm-tree rears its graceful head
above festoons of feathery leaves, in which clumps of red berries shine like
clusters of stars; tall quandong-trees and wild plums shoot up straight as
arrows, for the most part clear of vines and creepers, but not always successful
in escaping the embrace of the stag's horn fern, one of the handsomest of all
Australia's parasites; and the white-wooded umbrella-tree proudly asserts its
claim to preeminence, with its darkly lustrous laurel-shaped leaves surmounted
by long radiating spikes of crimson flowers, the brilliancy of which rivals the
glowing sunset of the South. Through the grand forests, in which for unnumbered
ages the dusky savage has roamed in freedom, never dreaming of the invasion of a
higher civilisation, flit flocks of resplendent parrots, chief among them being
the blue mountain, the rosella, and the crimson wing; black cockatoos, with
their dazzling tails spread out, are lurking in the branches of the bloodwood
trees, where they find both food and shelter; flycatchers, all green and gold,
are cunningly watching the waterholes for prey; laughing jackasses, with their
blue feathers and cold grey eyes, which are now twinkling with fun, are making
merry over the absurd antics of native companions, whose conceited hoppings and
twirlings are comic enough to inspire mirth in the dullest denizens of the
woods; while the soft musical notes of the bellbirds, all green and purple, blue
and golden, make harmonious the west wind which travels from the beeches, and
fill the air with melody strange and sweet.</p>

<p class="normal">Within hail of these summer evidences of loveliness and
grandeur stand two men, one young, the other not yet middle-aged. The younger
man, whose name is Basil Whittingham, is the embodiment of careless, indolent
grace, but just now he is evincing an unusual earnestness of manner, both in
speaking and listening. His age is barely twenty-three, and he bears about him
the unmistakable stamp of gentleman. This is not always the case with men who
have honest claims to the title, but with some few it is a gift. It is so with
Basil Whittingham. He has blue eyes, fair hair, a supple, graceful form, a
laughing mouth, with teeth like pearl, delicate hands, and a long, light-brown
moustache, which he evidently regards as a magnificent possession, and cherishes
and nurses as a thing of beauty. Otherwise he has not much to be proud of in the
shape of possessions, for his clothes would be anything but presentable in
Mayfair, though here in the Australian woods they may serve well enough. His
trousers, tucked into old knee boots, have conspicuously seen their best days;
his shirt, of some light material, has rents in it, showing the fair skin of his
arms embrowned by the sun where the sun could get at them; the sash round his
waist is frayed and faded; his wide-awake hat, sound in front, is tattered at
the back, where it flaps loosely over his flowing hair; and, moreover, he is
smoking a short black cutty. Yet despite these drawbacks, if drawbacks they can
be called in this land of freedom, freer indeed than any republic under the sun,
even the most ordinary observer would be ready to acknowledge that the man was a
gentleman. One, for instance, who would not do a dirty trick, who would not tell
a lie to serve his own interests, who would not betray a friend, and who would
be more likely to wrong himself than others. Tender, simple, brave; fearless,
but not foolhardy; openhearted, confiding, and unsuspicious of sinister, motives
in those with whom he has once shaken hands; with a sense of humour which
lightens adversity; regretting not the past, though he has wilfully steered his
boat into the Bay of Poverty, and dreading not the future; such is Basil
Whittingham, a typical type of an honest, frank, manly English gentleman.</p>

<p class="normal">His companion, by name Anthony Bidaud, was born and bred in
Switzerland, but is of French extraction. He speaks, English fluently, so well
indeed that those who serve him will not believe he is a foreigner. He has not
yet reached middle age, but he looks sixty at least, and on his worn, anxious
face dwells the expression of a man who is waiting for a mortal stroke. He is
well dressed, after the free bush fashion, and is no less a gentleman than Basil
Whittingham. It is the mutual recognition of social equality that keeps Basil
penniless and poorly clad, for he is a guest, not a dependent, on the plantation
of which Anthony Bidaud is master. This state of things suits the careless
nature of the younger gentleman, who, welcomed and received by Anthony Bidaud as
an equal, takes a pride in holding himself free from the touch of servitude.
Perhaps Annette, of whom you shall presently hear, serves as a factor in the
attitude he has chosen.</p>

<p class="normal">Being the hero of our story, it is needful that something
should be related of his career in the home country.</p>

<p class="normal">His parents were Devonshire people, and he their only child.
It was supposed that his father was a man of fortune; he lived as one, kept
hounds and horses, and maintained a costly establishment. Needless to say that
Basil was the idol of his parents; he was also the idol of a wealthy uncle, to
whom he paid a visit once in every year, and who, being childless, had announced
his intention of making Basil his heir. Thus, all seemed smooth and
pleasant-sailing before the young fellow. But misfortunes came; at the age of
fourteen he lost his mother. The memory of the solemn moments he spent by her
bedside before she closed her eyes upon the world, abided ever with Basil, whose
passionate adoration for the dear mother was a good testimony of his
affectionate disposition. But there was something deeper than affection in the
feelings he entertained for her. She had been to him more than a loving mother;
she had been his truest counsellor and friend. Upon her had devolved the
father's duty of inculcating in their child those strict principles of honour
and right-doing which set the seal of true manhood upon him who follows them out
in his course through life. Basil's father was of an easy, genial nature, and it
was from him that Basil inherited a cheerfulness of temper and a sense of humour
which lessened evils instead of magnifying them. The higher qualities of his
character came from his mother. Lying on her death-bed she impressed upon him
the beauty of honesty and uprightness, and the lad's heart responded to her
teaching.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never look to consequences, my dear child,&quot; she said. &quot;Do
always what is right; and when you are a man counsel and guide your dear
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He promised to obey her, but it was not until many years had
passed that he knew what she meant when she told him to counsel and guide his
father. It was she who had steered her husband's boat when it had got into
troubled waters, and steered it always into a safe harbour. No one knew it, no
one suspected it; not even her husband, who believed that it was due to himself
alone that he escaped dangers which threatened him from time to time; but this
ignorance was due to her wisdom, and partly, also, to her love; rather than
wound his feelings, she preferred to suffer herself. It is not to be inferred
from this remark that she had not led a happy life; she had, and her home was
happy in the truest sense; but she sighed to think of her husband, left alone to
grapple with difficulties which his easy nature prevented him from seeing.</p>

<p class="normal">She had a private fortune of her own, and with her husband's
consent she made a will devising it all to her son, with the exception of some
small legacies to humble friends. The money was to be invested, and to
accumulate till Basil was twenty-one years of age, when he was to come into
possession of it; so that, even without his uncle, he was comfortably provided
for. A short time after his mother's death, his father announced his intention
of giving up his establishment in the country and settling in London. The home
in which he had passed so many happy years with his wife was desolate and sad
now that she was gone from it; he wandered through the rooms with a weight on
his heart which memory made heavier instead of lighter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes Basil,&quot; he said to his son, &quot;it is the best thing I can
do. If I remain here I shall lose my reason; I must find some distraction from
grief.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil was too young to question this decision; what his father
resolved upon must be right. The old home was sold up, and father and son
removed to London. Then came the question of Basil's education. His uncle
considered removal to London a step in the wrong direction, and he wrote to that
effect; he also expressed his opinion that London was an unsuitable place in
which to conduct a young gentleman's education. &quot;Give the lad a tutor,&quot; he said,
&quot;and let him travel.&quot; This was done, and before he was fifteen years of age
Basil was living on the Continent, picking up knowledge and picking up pleasure
in not quite equal quantities, the latter predominating. It was an agreeable
life, and Basil did not harm by it. Every year he came to England, and spent a
month with his father in London and a week with his uncle in the country. On one
occasion he and his uncle spent this week together in the great city, living at
Morley's Hotel, Charing Cross, and seeing the sights, and this visit was
destined to be pregnant with strange results in years to come. Except upon all
other occasions the uncle received Basil in the country. The old gentleman was
full of quips and cranks and imaginary ills. He fancied himself an invalid, and
coddled himself up absurdly; and Basil, when he visited him, seldom left the
house. The forced seclusion did not trouble the young fellow; he could make
himself happy anywhere. Certainly there were few dull moments in his uncle's
house when Basil was in it, and the old gentleman, while not objecting to a
display of animal spirits, improved the opportunity by endeavouring to drive
into his nephew's head a special kind of worldly wisdom. As, for instance: All
men are rogues (ourselves excepted). Never open your heart to a friend (except
to an uncle who is going to leave you all his money). Keep your secrets. Spend
your money on your own pleasures and your own ambitions. Never make yourself
responsible for another man's debts. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This kind
of counsel was showered upon Basil, and produced no effect upon him whatever; he
was spared the trouble of arguing upon these matters, even if he were in the
humour for it--which he was not; he had a knack of avoiding disagreeable topics
by his uncle's everlasting assertion that the counsel he gave was absolutely
indisputable, and was to be received as such.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right, uncle,&quot; said Basil; &quot;now let us talk of something
else.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And he would fly off into accounts of such of his Continental
adventures as he knew would please the old fellow. He had a capital gift of
description, and the old man would sit huddled up in his arm-chair, cracking his
sides at his nephew's wit. Basil never bade his uncle good-bye without a cheque
for a substantial sum in his pocket. He was liberally provided for by his
father, but he did not despise his uncle's gifts. Seeing that his stories of his
travels amused his uncle, he said that he would one day write a book.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And when you write it,&quot; his uncle Said, &quot;burn it. Write a
book indeed! Put your time out at better interest, Basil. Make money, money,
money. Then people will bow down to you. <i>I'm</i> not a nice object to look
at, am I? But I've got money, and people bow down to
<i>me!</i> How much more will they be likely to do so to a handsome fellow like
you? Make money, my boy, make money, and stick to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Which worldly advice went as usual in at one ear and out at
the other. After all, the old gentleman's remarks had only a general
application; had there been any special interest at stake Basil would have
argued it stoutly enough, and thereby got himself into hot water.</p>

<p class="normal">So things went on till Basil was twenty-one years of age, when
he was to come into possession of his mother's fortune. On his birthday he wrote
to his father, saying he would be home in a fortnight, and full of kind
messages--messages which did not reach the sense of the man for whom they were
intended: on the day the letter was delivered at the London address his father
was lying in delirium on a bed from which he was never to rise. A week before he
intended to start for home Basil received a letter informing him of the sad
news. &quot;Come back immediately,&quot; the writer said, &quot;if you wish to see your father
alive.&quot; Basil did not lose a moment. Travelling as quickly as possible he
arrived at his father's house--too late. It was a terrible blow to him, more
terrible than the loss of his mother, for which he had been in a measure
prepared. Death came more slowly in her case, and she had instilled into her son
a spirit of resignation which softened the bereavement. Even before she drew her
last breath Basil had thought of her as an angel in heaven. But with his father
it was so sudden; there had been no preparation for the parting, no indication
of it. It was true that his father had been ailing for months, but he had been
careful not to alarm his son. He may have believed, as most men do, that the
worst would not happen; we are chary in applying to ourselves the rules we are
so ready to apply to others. Only in his last hour of consciousness, before he
fell into the delirium from which it was fated he should not recover, had he
asked for his desk, and taking from it a sheet of paper wrote a few words to his
son, which he desired should be delivered in the event of anything serious
happening to him. He did not believe it even then; had he been a religious man
he would have weighed the matter more deeply, but he was one who, living as
fairly good and moral a life as the average church-goer, seldom went to the
Divine fount for comfort and counsel. It might have been better for Basil if he
had, for a warning might have come to him to check the mad desire which had
taken possession of him.</p>

<p class="normal">Between him and Basil there had never been a harsh word. Each
bore for the other the truest affection. Never a cross, never an ill-tempered
look; unvarying sweetness had marked their intercourse. So sudden a separation
could have been nothing less than terrible to the living. It was long before
Basil recovered from it. With the exception of his crotchety old uncle he was
absolutely without kith or kin. Letters had passed between them with reference
to the sad event. &quot;I cannot come to London to attend the funeral,&quot; his uncle
wrote; &quot;I am too infirm and feeble. When you have settled your father's affairs
I shall be glad to see you to talk things over. It is time you made a serious
start in life. You have your mother's fortune, and your father's, which I should
say is a handsome one; you will have mine, though I intend to keep you out of it
as long as I can. You are a lucky dog; you ought to die a millionaire.&quot; A mortal
ending the absolute desirability of which may well be doubted. Basil replied,
hoping his uncle would live to a good old age, and promising to visit him as
soon as affairs were settled. In his father's desk he found the scrawl which the
dying man had written. It was very short.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear Basil,--The honour of my name is in your hands. Your
loving father.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had not strength to attach his name.</p>

<p class="normal">It was not until the day after the funeral that the
significance of these words impressed itself on Basil. &quot;The honour of my name is
in your hands.&quot; They were his father's last words to him. What meaning did they
bear? He had heard from his father's lawyers, informing him that they had the
will in their possession, and that they were at his service. He wrote to them,
to the effect that he would call upon them early the following morning.</p>

<p class="normal">The head of the firm received him gravely and courteously, and
gave orders that they were not to be disturbed.</p>

<p class="normal">The will had been drawn out years since, and no alteration had
been made in it. Everything was left to Basil, unreservedly to him. There were
affectionate allusions in it which drew tears from Basil's eyes. When this
emotion had subsided he observed that the lawyer was regarding him with an air
of curiosity.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;May I ask,&quot; said the lawyer, &quot;if full confidence existed
between you and your father?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The fullest,&quot; replied Basil. &quot;He had no secrets from me, nor
I any from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer seemed sensibly relieved. &quot;You know of his
speculations?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His speculations!&quot; exclaimed Basil, in surprise. &quot;I was not
aware that he speculated.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then full confidence did not exist between you. I warned him;
I could do no more than that. In my experience, my dear sir, I have seen so many
go the same way. There is but one end to it, and this has ended as the others
have done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will listen to nothing against my father,&quot; said Basil
warmly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have nothing to say against him,&quot; responded the lawyer,
&quot;except that he was unwise. He had an intense craving to leave you a very large
fortune, and this craving became a kind of disease in him, and led him on. I
regret to tell you that all his speculations have ended disastrously.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is to say, have resulted in a loss?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In great losses.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To what extent?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Claims are pouring in. If they are satisfied, the will in
your hands is not worth more than waste paper. But some of the claims may be
contested, and in my belief successfully. But that will be a matter for
counsel's opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It has nothing to do with counsel,&quot; said Basil; &quot;it has to do
with me. I am my dear father's representative, and it is for me to determine
what is to be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Undoubtedly. Instructions must come from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Claims are pouring in, you say. Can you tell me to what
amount?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As far as we have received them; there are more to be
presented you understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Plainly, then,&quot; said the lawyer, &quot;the property your father
has left will not be sufficient to meet his debts.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They must be paid, however.&quot; The lawyer inclined his head.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Basil, rising and pacing the room in his
excitement, &quot;they must be paid. No stigma must rest upon my father's memory.
Some of the claims may be contested, you say? In justice?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Legally,&quot; replied the lawyer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I ask you again,&quot; said Basil. &quot;In justice?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer, declining to commit himself, made no reply.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At least,&quot; said Basil, &quot;you can answer me this question. My
father owes the money?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, my dear sir, he owes the money.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then it must be paid. Do you not see that it <i>must</i> be
paid? No man shall have the power of uttering one word against him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But,&quot; said the lawyer, eyeing the young man as he would have
eyed a psychological puzzle, &quot;if the estate left by your father is not
sufficient to satisfy all these claims, what is to be done?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have money of my own--my mother's fortune--of which you
have the particulars.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, we can give you all the information you require, and it
requires but your signature to a few documents, already prepared, my dear sir,
to place you in possession of this very handsome inheritance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can probably tell me the amount of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Almost to a farthing. It is invested in the safest
securities, realisable at an hour's notice, and it amounts to,&quot;--the lawyer took
some papers from a japanned box and ran his eye over them--&quot;it amounts to not
less than twenty-three thousand pounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will that,&quot; asked Basil, &quot;with my father's estate, satisfy in
full the claims which are pouring in?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But my dear sir,&quot; expostulated the lawyer, with a look of
astonishment.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil would not allow him to conclude. &quot;I have to repeat some
of my questions, it seems,&quot; he said. &quot;Will this fortune, which is realisable in
an hour, satisfy in full the claims of my father's creditors?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lawyer shrugged his shoulders, and replied briefly, &quot;More
than satisfy them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then the matter is settled,&quot; said Basil. &quot;I empower you to
collect the whole of these claims to the uttermost farthing; to convert the
securities which are mine into money; to prepare a complete balance sheet, and
to pay my father's creditors in full, with as little delay as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am to accept these instructions as definite and decisive?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As definite and decisive!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They shall be followed and carried out with as little delay
as possible. I must trouble you to call here at three o'clock this afternoon to
sign the necessary papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will be punctual. Good morning; and I am greatly obliged to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning, my dear sir,&quot; said the lawyer, adding under his
breath, &quot;and I am greatly astonished at you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At three o'clock that afternoon Basil called again at the
lawyer's office, and signed &quot;the necessary papers,&quot; and went away with a light
heart and a smiling face. Within a month the affair was concluded, his father's
estate was realised, and his father's creditor's paid in full. There remained to
him then, out of his mother's fortune, the sum of three thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="normal">He was perfectly happy and contented. Long before the business
was finally settled he had realised what his father meant by his last few
written words: &quot;My dear Basil,--The honour of my name is in your hands. Your
loving father.&quot; To good hands indeed had the honour of a dead man's name been
entrusted. Basil had preserved it unsullied, unblemished.</p>

<p class="normal">He took no credit for it; he had fulfilled a sacred trust. It
was simply a duty performed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;I will go and see my uncle.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But while he was preparing to start he received a letter from
that gentleman, which will explain why the visit was never paid.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nephew Basil&quot; (the letter ran), &quot;I have received news of your
mad proceedings since your return home. No person in his sober senses would have
acted as you have done. The greater portion of the claims made against your
father's estate could have been legally and successfully contested, and even in
what remained a sharp lawyer could have obtained a substantial abatement. This
view, as I understand, was presented to you by an able firm of solicitors, but
you rejected it, and chose to play the fool. Now, I do not care to have dealings
with a fool.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I might have pardoned you for sacrificing your father's
estate to satisfy these claims, but I will not pardon you for sacrificing the
fortune your mother left you. It proves to me that it is not safe to entrust
money to you, and I have decided to put mine to better use than to leave it to
you. Accept this intimation as my ultimatum. It is the last letter you will ever
receive from me, and you will never see me again. Therefore you need not go to
the trouble of coming my way. My house is not open to you. All the good counsel
I have given you has been thrown away. You might have told me at the time and I
should have saved my breath and my patience. Good-bye, foolish nephew.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40%"><span class="sc">&quot;Bartholomew Whittingham.&quot;</span></p>
<br>

<p class="normal">He was angry enough to add a postscript:</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;As you are so fond of paying debts for which you are not
responsible, what do you say to considering the money I have given you from time
to time as one, and handing it back? You can do as you please about it. I can
make no legal demand for it, but I gave it to you under the impression that you
were not exactly an idiot. It amounts to quite fourteen hundred pounds. If I had
it I would put it out at good interest.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">To state that Basil was not hurt by this letter would be to
state what is not true. He had an affection for the old fellow, and he was
greatly pained to think that all was over between them; but he was not in the
least disturbed by the old man's arguments. He had done what was right; of this
he was sure. But the letter stung Basil as well as hurt him. There was a bitter
twang in his uncle's remark that he could make no legal demand for the money he
had given his nephew. &quot;He shall have it back,&quot; said Basil, &quot;every farthing of
it.&quot; Then he was seized with an expensive fit of humour. His uncle had spoken of
interest. He would prove that he was not a whit less independent than the old
fellow himself. He made some lame and ridiculous calculations of interest at
five per cent, per annum, and arrived at the sum of two thousand pounds and a
few pence. He got a draft for the amount, and inclosed it in the following
note:--</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right, my dear uncle. Here is your money back again, with
interest added. If it is not enough interest, let me know, and I will send you
more. Good-bye, and good luck to you.</p>

<p style="text-indent:40%">&quot;Your affectionate nephew,</p>

<p style="text-indent:55%">&quot;<span class="sc">Basil</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">This last debt paid, Basil had barely a thousand pounds left.
He did not hear from his uncle again.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, what was he to do? He was without profession or trade,
and did not feel equal for any kind of service he saw around, even if it was
offered to him. &quot;I think,&quot; he said, &quot;I will travel a little more.&quot; He did so,
and was prudent enough to travel in an economic spirit but his money went fast
enough for all that. At the end of a year and a half he had in his purse exactly
one hundred pounds. Was he dashed? Not a bit. But he knew that something must be
done. &quot;I will go to Australia,&quot; he said. The project exalted him. He glowed, he
rubbed his hands, he was in a whirl of pleasant excitement. He would be in a new
land, in a land of adventure, in a land of romance. There he would be all right,
of course. Not a doubt of it. As for his empty purse--and it <i>was</i> pretty
well empty by the time he had paid for his passage and a few necessary odds and
ends--he scarcely gave it a thought. Was he not going to Australia, the poor
man's El Dorado? So he set forth in a sailing vessel, and enjoyed the passage
immensely, and landed in Sydney as happy as a king. The fairy harbour, the most
beautiful in all the wide world, enchanted him; the ravishing scenery enchanted
him; the quaint old city, so home-like in its appearance, enchanted him.
Certainly he had come to the right place.</p>

<p class="normal">He was rather more melancholy a few weeks afterwards, but he
never lost heart. Suitable employment did not present itself so readily as he
had thought it would, and gold was not to be picked up in the streets. &quot;I am
making a mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;I must not remain in the city; I must go into the
bush.&quot; He soon made a start, and began tramping Queensland way, and after some
weeks of wondering reached the tract of country which Anthony Bidaud had taken
up.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_02" href="#div1Ref_02">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">On the plantation which he had brought almost to perfection by
twenty years of wise labour Anthony Bidaud lived with his only child, Annette,
fourteen years of age. He had no other of his kindred near him. The wife he
brought from Switzerland lay in a flower-covered grave within a mile of the spot
upon which he stood. They came to the colony childless, but after a lapse of
years Annette was born to them. Until the child was nine years of age the fond
mother was spared to rear her, and then one morning Annette awoke to find the
dear protector lost to her. It was an irreparable loss in that far-away land,
and there was no one of her own sex to take the mother's place. But Annette had
her father left, and he, not unsuccessfully, strove to fill the void in his
child's life. He was unremitting in his tenderness and watchfulness, and he
bestowed upon his little one a full-hearted love. The two had lived together
till now, when Anthony Bidaud's heart was gloomed by the fear of approaching
death. He had never been strong, and the climate of the new world in which he
had made his home was destined to be fatal to him. He made pilgrimages to Sydney
and Melbourne to consult the best physicians, but they gave him little hope.
Death was approaching surely and swiftly. A gnawing pain, an inexpressible
grief, stirred his heart as he thought of his child, whom he idolised. The
reflection that she would be left alone in this wild spot, in this remote part
of the world, without a relative, with scarcely a friend, appalled him. Yet what
could he do?</p>

<p class="normal">He had neither sought nor made friends, he and his wife and
child had been sufficient for each other, and when his wife died he and Annette
sighed for no other companionship. But had he sought friendships he would not
have succeeded in making them in any but fitful fashion. His nearest neighbour
was twenty miles away, and everybody in the colony was so intent upon &quot;getting
on&quot; and making his fortune, that there was no time for social intercourse. In
colonial cities there was at that time but little &quot;society;&quot; in the bush, none.</p>

<p class="normal">About a hundred feet above the blue clear stream of the
Pioneer stood the house in which Anthony Bidaud lived. The slabs with which it
was built had been split from the gum and bloodwood trees growing in the forest
which lay in the rear of the huts and buildings inhabited by the labourers,
chiefly South Sea Islanders, who worked on the plantation. The roof was composed
of shingles split from the same description of trees. The interior of the house
was lined with rich, dark red cedar, which grew in the thick scrub on the
opposite banks of the river. An avenue of bananas led from the house along the
cliff to an arbour, in which oranges, custard apples, guavas, and other
delicious fruits, ripened in unsurpassed perfection. The posts of the verandahs
which surrounded three sides of the house were covered by gigantic passion
fruit, except at one end, which was completely enclosed by grape vines and the
yellow jessamine. Hammocks were slung in the verandahs, and the occupants could
swing idly to and fro, shaded from the hot sun, and within reach of the fruit
which grew in such wonderful abundance and luxuriance all around. A lovely home
for husband, wife, and children; a dream which a poet soul only could properly
appreciate, but for one simple human being, in whose days the flower of human
affection was not blossoming--little better than a wilderness.</p>

<p class="normal">It was of this sad prospect, which his state of health warned
him lay before Annette, that Anthony Bidaud was speaking to Basil at the time of
their introduction to the reader. They had been acquainted but a short time, but
each bore for the other a genuine esteem. Some kindred qualities of
independence, high-mindedness, and honesty of purpose had drawn them together
from the hour they first met, and would have drawn them even closer in the
future; but the shadows gathering over one life marred this fulfilment of a
brighter promise. Barely two months had elapsed since Basil Whittingham,
presenting himself to Anthony Bidaud, had asked for a shelter of his roof for a
night. Annette was present when Basil appeared; by her side a faithful Scotch
terrier, who guarded his young mistress with watchful care, and when needed,
with ferocity. Basil stooped and patted the head of the dog, who did not snarl
and show his teeth, as was his wont with strangers, but submitted to the
familiarity with unusual amiability. The sensible creature went even farther
than this; he rose, and rubbed his head against Basil's leg, courting by the
action a continuance of the caressing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Father,&quot; said Annette, &quot;no stranger has ever done that with
Bruno before.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bruno and I are old friends,&quot; said Basil, with a pleasant
smile. Annette thought that she had never seen such beautiful teeth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, Bruno,&quot; she cried reproachfully, &quot;and you never told me!
Come here directly, sir!&quot; Bruno approached her, wagging his tail. &quot;Really old
friends?&quot; she asked turning to Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, not really,&quot; he replied. &quot;What I mean is, I love dogs,
and dogs love me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A good testimonial,&quot; remarked Anthony Bidaud, gazing with
interest upon this poorly attired gentleman.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have found it so,&quot; responded Basil, &quot;for dog and man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He held out his hand to Annette, who not only took it, but
retained it. This went far to complete the conquest of Anthony Bidaud. With the
ordinary tramp he was very familiar, but here was a man of another breed. No
hang-dog looks, no slouching, no lowering of the brows, no prison-mark about
him. An upright gentleman, who looked the man he was asking a favour from square
in the face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you travelled far?&quot; asked Anthony Bidaud.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About twenty miles I should say. Rather too hot a day for so
long a walk.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must be tired,&quot; said Anthony Bidaud. &quot;You are heartily
welcome here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank you,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">That this young man had so swiftly won favour with his child
and her four-footed protector was a sufficient recommendation to Bidaud, but,
independent of that, he was rejoiced to meet with a gentleman from whom manners
and polish of good society had not been rubbed off by familiarity with the
rougher aspects of life in the new world. Basil was a man whom no experience
could harden; the inner grain of his nature was refined and sweet. The hardships
he had already met with in the colony had not embittered him in the least. He
grumbled at nothing, took all things easily, and showed a smiling face to the
world. When he presented himself to Anthony Bidaud he was really at his wits'
end, but though he had not tasted food that day he was not discouraged or
disheartened. A clean conscience is a wonderful sustainer. &quot;I am like a cat,&quot;
thought Basil, as he trudged blithely through the bush, &quot;I am bound to fall on
my feet&quot;. And fall on his feet he did that summer afternoon, which was to be the
prelude of many happier days; for before the night was over he told his host
sufficient of his antecedents to satisfy Bidaud that his hospitality was not
likely to be misplaced. Upon his persuasion his guest remained for a week, then
for another week, and so on till the present time. Bidaud was diffident in
asking Basil to enter his service, and Basil, though he had come to the
plantation with a vague idea of seeking employment, did not entertain it after
his first introduction to Bidaud and his daughter. The terms upon which they had
met and upon which he was received forbade his asking for employment. It was
gentleman and gentleman, not master and servant. But at length Bidaud--who had
learned sufficient to be aware that Basil's purse was empty, and that he had no
friends in the colony--delicately pressed his guest upon the subject, and, as
timidly as though he was asking a favour instead of being anxious to bestow one,
hinted at some business connection between them. Basil, from scruples with which
we are familiar but which he did not explain to his host, would not entertain
the idea, but firmly and courteously set it aside.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have your future to look to,&quot; said Bidaud.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is time enough to think of that,&quot; said Basil,
cheerfully. &quot;I am not so very old.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Many a time did Bidaud look with eyes of affection at Basil,
and wish he had a son like him to whom he could entrust his darling Annette.
Basil was a man peculiarly adapted to inspire affection in honest, simple
hearts, and such a bond grew between him and Annette. Happy is the man whose
manners cause children to regard him as one of themselves; he possesses an
inheritance of pleasant hours which money cannot purchase. Basil and Annette,
then, spent a great deal of time together, accompanied by the faithful Bruno,
and it gladdened the father's heart to see his child so happy in the society of
their new friend.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Father says your name is Whittingham,&quot; said Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; said the young man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Whittingham.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Do you like it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No. You must have another name.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course I have. Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil. That is much nicer, ever so much nicer. I shall call
you Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall feel honoured, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This compact being made, Annette took him in hand; the little
maid had already discovered that she knew a great deal which he did not, and she
set up a school, with Basil as her only pupil. Whether what she taught was
likely to be of use to him in the battle of life he was bound to fight is an
open question. Had some foreknowledge come upon him as to the nature of that
battle, and the roads into which it would lead him, he would have laughingly
rejected it as the wildest of fancies. He was quite content with the present; he
had found an enchanting companion, and time was passing delightfully. During
Annette's five years of motherless life she had acquired a wonderful knowledge
of the fauna and the flora of the colony, and to these mysteries she introduced
Basil. It is not incorrect to call them mysteries, for they are really so to
ninety-nine out of every hundred colonials, who spend their lives in ignorance
of the wonders by which they are surrounded. But it is so in all lands.</p>

<p class="normal">Annette, then, opened Basil's mind, and let in knowledge. She
showed him how to snare game, which abounded in vast quantities, snipe, quail,
and numerous varieties of duck, of which the whistling duck is the most curious,
and the black duck the best eating; she taught him the names of the strange and
beautiful birds which found their home in the scrub and forests round about; she
described to him the different trees which grew in the neighbourhood of the
beautiful Pioneer River, and would not rest contented till he was familiar with
them, and could give them their right names.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is this, Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is this, Annette? Why, a tree.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But what kind of tree?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, I beg your pardon. Ha--hum--oh, yes, it is the tea-tree.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is not, Basil. It is the bottle-tree.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, the bottle-tree. Of course it is the bottle-tree. How
could I be so stupid?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are not stupid; you are inattentive. Do you see this hole
cut in the tree?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not have that answer. 'Of course I do' sounds as if I
had no right to ask the question. Say 'I do.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And mean it, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I mean it,&quot; said Basil, with his hand on his heart, and a
merry twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very good. You see the hole. Who cut it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On my word of honour, Annette, I haven't the slightest idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was cut by the blacks. Now, what did they cut it for?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How on earth should I know?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You ought to know. You have been brought up in a very bad
school. I'll show you what for. Out with your knife, Basil. Dig it in here, a
long way under the hole. That is right. Now you can have a good drink of cold
sweet water. Is it not wonderful?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed it is. Like Oliver Twist, I ask for more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The conversation instantly took another turn. There were but
few books on the home station, and among them no work of fiction. It fell to
Basil's lot to open a new fairyland in the young girl's life. &quot;What was Oliver
Twist?&quot; &quot;He was not a 'what'; he was a 'who.'&quot; &quot;Then who was Oliver Twist?&quot;
Basil told the story as well as he could, and afterwards told another; and after
the second tale, still another, this time a more simple one, from the magic
cupboard of Hans Christian Andersen. It was long before they resumed their
woodland lessons. Annette pointed out where the best figs and almonds grew,
instructed him how to make bracelets and necklaces out of the stones of the
quandong fruit, and where the sugar bags of the native bees were to be found.
They caught a native bear, not a very ferocious creature and tamed it in a few
days so thoroughly that it followed them about like a dog, to the disgust of
Bruno, who did not approve of the proceeding; they gathered wild ginger and wild
nutmegs in the scrub, and in a famous creek they caught quantities of golden
perch, with red eyes and double chins; and once they saw two emus in the
distance, and heard the faint sound of their peculiar whistle. In such-like
idling the days flew by, and the hours were all too short, but suddenly it
dawned upon Basil that this lotus life could not last for ever. It was from a
sense of duty, and with a sinking heart (for the thought of parting from these
good friends, especially from Annette, sorely oppressed him) that he intimated
to Anthony Bidaud that he had lingered too long, and must go farther afield.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must not outstay my welcome,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You cannot do that,&quot; said Bidaud. &quot;Are you not happy here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Too happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, one cannot be too happy,&quot; said Bidaud, in a tone of great
sadness. There was that weighing on his heart which he yearned to impart to some
person in whom he could confide. He had thought of it for days past, and had
resolved to unbosom his sorrow to the young gentleman who had brought a new
light of tenderness into the prosperous home.</p>

<p class="normal">His story was told. Basil learned that the father feared he
had not long to live, and that he was filled with apprehension at the
contemplation of Annette being left without a friend.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You were born in Switzerland,&quot; said Basil, thoughtfully. &quot;Is
there no one connected with you in your own country into whose charge you could
give Annette?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is twenty years since I left my native land,&quot; said Bidaud,
&quot;and great changes must have taken place during that time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You left relatives there?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, a sister--and a brother.&quot; His mention of his brother was
made with evident reluctance.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why not write to your brother,&quot; asked Basil, &quot;to come and
receive the trust?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Heaven forbid!&quot; cried Bidaud. &quot;Give my darling child into
Gilbert's care! I would as soon give her into the care of a wolf! No, no, it is
not to be thought of. Six months ago I wrote to my sister, in whom I have some
confidence--she is a woman, and would surely not ill-treat my child--informing
her of my circumstances, and of the certain fate which awaited me, and imploring
her to come out to me. I promised to provide for her, and for her family, if she
had any. I thought that the knowledge that I was rich would tempt her. To that
letter I have received no reply. Basil&quot;--like his daughter, he called his guest
by his Christian name--&quot;it is the sad and sober truth that you are the only
friend upon whom I can rely to render me a service. Will you do so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If it is in my power,&quot; said Basil, gravely.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have given me the impression that you are alone in the
world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Practically alone,&quot; replied Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With no kindred who have claims upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My parents are dead; I was their only child. There is but one
man alive in England who is of my blood--an uncle whose heir I was to be, but
who has cast me off.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;May I inquire for what reason?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For a very serious reason. I did not know the value of money,
he said. My father, when he died, was heavily involved, and I ruined myself in
paying his debts. My uncle was angry at this, saying there was no obligation
upon me to satisfy my father's creditors. I held, and hold, a different opinion;
but the consequence was that my uncle abandoned his intention of making me his
heir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My task is all the easier for your explanation. The service I
am about to ask of you is no light one, and may be agreeable to you because it
will open out a future which few men would turn their back upon. I do not say
this to tempt you, for I know that you will be guided entirely by your own
feelings, by your own sense of right and wrong, and that worldly advantage will
weigh for nothing in the scale. You are fond of Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I love the child; I never met with a sweeter and more
sympathetic nature than hers. She has strength of character, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you think so?&quot; asked Bidaud, anxiously.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am sure of it. Even now she rules me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Bidaud shook his head with a sad smile. &quot;That is not a proof.
You are content to be ruled, and what passes between you springs from affection.
The strength of character required to battle with the world is of a different
kind from that which Annette exhibits towards you. The service I ask you to
render me concerns Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, then,&quot; said Basil, gaily, &quot;it is rendered before you ask
for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must know its nature before you consent. It is nothing
more nor less, Basil, than that you should stand to my child in the light of
guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil started. The tone in which this was spoken was that of a
man who was convinced that the world was slipping from him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Surely you are alarming yourself unnecessarily,&quot; said the
young man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am not. There are warnings which it would be criminal to
neglect, especially where there is such a vital interest at stake as the
happiness of an only and beloved child. I have received these warnings and must
be prepared. Say that the spiritual whisper which tells me that my end is
approaching is false, is no faith to be placed in the doctor's decree that my
hours are numbered? A man may have morbid fancies, but the teachings of
experience and science are not to be lightly set aside and disregarded. If my
fears prove groundless, so much the better for Annette; if they are
confirmed--which they will be, Basil, nothing can alter it--so much the worse
for her unless needful preparation is made for the crisis in her young life.
Will you now consent?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me hear more fully what you have to say,&quot; replied Basil,
gravely, &quot;before I fully pledge myself. You speak of a brother and sister in
your own country, and you have written to one who may appear at any moment. The
claim she has upon Annette, and the authority with which the laws of nature have
invested her, are stronger than those of any stranger. I am a young man, and the
idea of becoming guardian to so tender and sweet a flower as Annette startles
me. I ask myself, am I equal to a responsibility so serious, and the question
reveals to me my own deficiencies, of which I am generally somewhat painfully
aware. It is really as though the most serious page in my life was about to be
opened.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_03" href="#div1Ref_03">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have no fears,&quot; said Anthony Bidaud, with a gentle smile,
&quot;on the score of your deficiencies. I have been no inattentive observer since
the fortunate day upon which I first formed acquaintance with you. That you have
had a disappointment in life counts for very little, and such small difficulties
as befall a newcomer in this new land are scarcely to be accounted among the
real difficulties of life. You do not yet know your own strength, but already,
in a position of serious responsibility, you have acted in a manner which few
men would have had the courage to do. Your past is honourable, and contents me.
You have a kind heart, and that adds to my content. Should the worst happen, my
Annette will have by her side a true and honest counsellor. Reflect a moment.
Say that I were to die to-morrow--nay, do not argue with me; death is the only
certain thing in life, and it may come at any unexpected moment to the
strongest--say that I die to-morrow, what would be the position of my dear
child? I have an estate worth thousands of pounds; she is a mere child, and
could not manage it. She would become the prey of schemers, who would
undoubtedly not deal fairly by her. I have a hundred servants on this
plantation, and not a friend among them. By accident you enter into our lives. I
use the term accident, but I believe it to be a providence. We are drawn to each
other. I have observed you closely, and am satisfied to deliver into your hands
a sacred charge, the charge of a young girl's future. At such moments as these
there comes to some men a subtle, unfathomable insight. It comes to me. I firmly
believe that there is a link between you and my child which, if you do not
recognise it now, you will be bound to recognise in the future. It may be broken
in the present, but the threads will be joined as surely as we stand here side
by side. Apart from this mysticism, to which I do not expect you to subscribe,
there is a worldly, practical side which it is right and necessary you should
understand. You ask for fuller information of my brother and sister. I will give
it to you. That my brother and I did not part friends, and that his attitude
towards me influenced my sister, was not my fault. I loved a young girl in my
own station in life, and she loved me and afterwards became my wife. That my
brother Gilbert loved her also was to be deplored; we were not to be blamed for
it, though Gilbert was furious--with me for loving her, with her for returning
my love. I endeavoured to remonstrate with him: he would not listen to me. 'You
have stepped in the way of my happiness,' he said; 'you shall rue it.' It is
hard to speak harshly of one's flesh and blood, but it is the truth that the
girl I loved was fortunate in not placing her affections upon him. He would have
broken her heart. He was a spendthrift and a libertine, and would stop at little
for the gratification of his selfish pleasures. He was furious against me, not
so much because he loved Annette's mother, but because he could not have his own
way. He was clever in crooked things, and in cunning shrewdness there were few
to beat him. Educated as a doctor, he could have earned a good name if he had
chosen to be industrious; but he preferred to lead an idle, dissolute life.
These evil courses caused him to be deeply in debt at the time of my father's
death. A portion of my father's fortune, which was not very large, was left to
me, and Gilbert endeavoured to rob me of it, saying he was the elder, as he was
by a year. With wedded life in view I resisted the attempt, and this angered him
the more. He swore that he would never forgive me, and that he would be revenged
upon me. It was strange that my sister leaned more towards him than towards me,
but that does sometimes happen with the scapegrace of the family. I am not
endeavouring to blacken Gilbert's character for my own glorification. In drawing
his picture I have dealt more than justly by him; were he not my brother I
should speak of actions of his which made me wonder how he and I could have been
born of the same mother. It is that I wish you to understand why I did not write
to him to come here and take charge of my dear child, and to understand why I
said that I would as soon give her into the care of a wolf. I succeeded in
obtaining my share of my father's fortune, and soon afterwards married. Even
then Gilbert did not cease from persecuting me. He would come and take up his
quarters in our house, and insult my wife, and revile me, unto our life became
intolerable. It was then that we resolved to emigrate, chiefly to escape his
persecutions. Then he showed us plainly that his love had changed to hate. He
said to me before I left Switzerland, 'One day I will be even with you. Remember
my words--dead or alive, I will be even with you!' Since that day I have never
seen him, never heard from him, and I do not know whether he is still living.
Upon our arrival in this colony fortune smiled upon us almost from the first. We
were happy, very happy, and as you see I have been prosperous. But I have not
been wise. I should have provided my child with a suitable companion at the
death of my wife, though heaven knows where I should have found one; but I
should have tried. To marry again was impossible; I loved my wife too well, and
I could not be false to her memory. I have been worse than unwise: I have
neglected a serious duty. Up to this day I have shrunk from making a will, so
that my affairs would get into confusion should anything happen to me. I have
resolved to make instant amends for this neglect of duty. To-night I shall write
to a lawyer to come to me without an hour's delay, and he shall draw out my will
before he departs. In this will it is my desire to appoint you manager of my
estate and guardian of my child till she arrives at the age of twenty-one. It is
not a bad prospect I hold out to you. At the end of seven years you will still
be a young man, and if you elect to leave Annette you can do so. She will by
that time have learned from you all that is necessary to continue the management
of the estate herself; but she will also then be free to act as she pleases:
either to remain upon it, or to sell it and go elsewhere. I do not think there
is anything more I can tell you to enable you to arrive at a decision. I do not
urge you to comply with my desire because of any personal advantage that may
accrue to yourself, but I beg of you as a friend to render me as great a service
as it is in the power of one man to render to another. If you wish for time to
consider this proposal take it, but decide before the arrival of the lawyer. One
way or another, my will must be made before a week has passed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But Basil did not ask for time; he was deeply touched by the
confidence reposed in him by Anthony Bidaud, and while the father spoke he had
made up his mind. He had been very happy on the plantation; he knew that it was
a desirable home, and that within its domains could be found much that would
make a man's life agreeable and useful He had come to the colony, as had
thousands of other colonists, with the intention of making his fortune and
returning to England. He could not hope to make a fortune in a day, though wild
ideas of gold-seeking--successful gold-seeking, of course--had floated through
his mind. Suddenly, when his fortunes were at the lowest ebb, there was
presented an opportunity which, unworldly as he was, he could not disguise from
himself it would be folly to throw away. But it was due to Anthony Bidaud that
the matter should not be concluded without something more being said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I need no time to consider,&quot; he said. &quot;Your proposition is
flattering and advantageous to myself. But you speak of not being wise. Are you
wise in placing a trust so delicate and important in the hands of a stranger?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am content to do so,&quot; said Bidaud, &quot;and I beg you to
believe that the obligation will be on my side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;After all,&quot; suggested Basil, with a little touch of
shrewdness &quot;it may be with you a choice of evils.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a choice of good,&quot; observed Bidaud. &quot;I have told you,&quot;
continued Basil, &quot;that I have not been educated into an understanding of
business matters, and that my mission in life&quot;--here he smiled
deprecatingly--&quot;was to go through life in a gentlemanly way, without working for
my living.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But you came to the colony to work?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. I am only endeavouring to prove to you how utterly unfit
I am for the position you would assign to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am entirely convinced,&quot; said Bidaud, with a look of
affection at the young man, &quot;of your fitness for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Think of my inexperience.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Experience will come to you as it came to me. You will learn
as I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then there is another view,&quot; said Basil, and now he spoke
with a certain hesitation. &quot;You and Annette are here as father and daughter. It
is not to be supposed that I could supply your place. I am a young man; in a
very few years Annette will be a young woman. Will not our relative positions
then be likely to wound her susceptibilities----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do not finish,&quot; said Bidaud, pressing Basil's hand warmly.
&quot;Leave all to time. Nothing but good can spring from what I propose. If Annette
were now a young woman----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And here he himself purposely broke off in the middle of a
sentence. Certainly his manner could not be mistaken. A flush came into Basil's
face, and he did not speak again for a few moments.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Has the letter,&quot; he then said, &quot;you wrote to your sister been
returned to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then it must have been delivered.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not necessarily. I am not sure whether undelivered letters
addressed to Switzerland are returned to the colonial post-offices. If you have
stated your principal objections I see nothing in them to cause you to hesitate.
You will consent?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Basil, &quot;I accept the trust.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With all my heart I thank you,&quot; said Anthony Bidaud; then he
placed his hands on Basil's shoulders, and said in a solemn tone, &quot;Guard my
child.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whatever lies in my power to do,&quot; said Basil, &quot;shall be
done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Bidaud nodded and turned away; his heart was too full to say
more. Basil turned in another direction, with the intention of seeking Annette,
in fulfilment of a promise he had made to join her in the woods. He knew where
to find her.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_04" href="#div1Ref_04">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Traversing a narrow, winding bridle track, he soon reached the
river. A broad belt of white sand stretched on either side for some little
distance, the water glistening like polished mirrors in its smooth, deep
reaches. Here and there it broke into a thousand tiny silver-crested waves,
created by the inequalities in the ground. Farther on the main stream twisted
into great clusters of dark green river oaks, and was lost to view. The white
sands narrowed, and were replaced by rocks, covered with moss and lichen, and
here a bark canoe was moored. Stepping on a large boulder, Basil jumped into the
canoe, and loosening the rope, paddled down stream. The water ran like a mill
race, and presently divided into two streams, beautified by waterfalls and fairy
islands adorned with luxuriant vegetation. This dividing of the waters extended
only some three or four hundred yards, at the termination of which they were
united in one dark lagoon. A strange stillness reigned upon the surface of the
water, but this sign of peace was insincere, the current in reality running hard
and strong. Round about the canoe floated masses of white and mauve water
lilies; in parts the huge leaves formed a perfect carpet, which easily supported
the light weight of the lotus birds as they skipped from shore to shore. At the
lower end of the lagoon the stream became so narrow that a man could jump across
it, and here Basil left his canoe, and plunged into the woods to find Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">She was sitting on a great patch of velvet moss, idling with
some flowers of the wax plant and the yellow hibiscus. Her back was towards
Basil, who stepped softly, intending to surprise her, but the crackling of the
leaves betrayed him. She turned quickly, and jumping up, ran to meet him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have been waiting for you ever so long,&quot; she said, and she
slipped her hand into his.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil made no excuse for being late; an age seemed to have
passed since he had last seen her, though scarcely three hours separated &quot;then&quot;
from &quot;now.&quot; But short as was really the interval it had effected an important
alteration in their relations towards each other, and the contemplation of this
change made him silent. Neither was Annette as talkative as usual, and they
strolled idly along for some distance without exchanging a word. Basil had
hitherto accepted Annette's beauty in a general sense; she was pretty, she was
bright, she was full of vivacity--that was all. Had she been a woman he would
have subjected her to a closer and more analytical observation, for he had an
artist's eye for beauty, and loved to look at it in animate and inanimate
nature; but Annette was only a child, and he had paid her just that amount of
attention which one pays to small wild-flowers that grow by the wayside. But
now, looking down upon her as she walked by his side, he observed that her eyes
were hazel, and he said to himself that hazel eyes, in girl and woman, were the
most beautiful eyes in the world. The hazel colour in the eyes he was gazing
upon was brilliant, and Basil said to himself that it was the brilliant hazel
eyes that are the most beautiful in the world. Annette's features were not
exactly regular, but formed as fair a picture of human loveliness as a man would
wish to see, her lips sweetly curved, her teeth white and shapely, her ears like
little shells, her golden brown hair gathered carelessly about the gracefully
shaped head. Yes, Annette was beautiful even now as a child; how much more
beautiful was she likely to be when her springtime was fully set in!</p>

<p class="normal">Raising her head suddenly she saw that Basil was gazing at her
more earnestly and closely than he was in the habit of doing. &quot;I was looking at
your eyes, Annette,&quot; he said, rather guiltily. &quot;I never noticed their colour
till to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are hazel. Do you like hazel eyes?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am glad of that. My eyes are like my mother's. Will you
come with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To her grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had visited it before with Annette, and they now walked
towards the canoe, gathering wild flowers as they walked. Once Annette slipped,
and he caught her and held her up; there was an unusual tenderness in the
action, and Annette nestled closer to him, and smiled happily. In the canoe her
skilful fingers were busily at work, weaving the flowers they had gathered into
garlands to lay upon her mother's grave. She had a special gift in such-like
graceful tasks, but then her heart was in her fingers. The loving homage was
reverently rendered when they reached the spot, and Basil assisted her in
clearing the dead leaves and in planting some fresh roots she had brought with
her from the woods.</p>

<p class="normal">Her task accomplished, Annette sat beside the grave, with a
wistful expression on her face which made Basil wonder what was stirring in her
mind. He waited for her to break the silence, and presently she spoke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What makes you so quiet, Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not know. Perhaps it is because you have said so little,
Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have been thinking.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wanted all day to speak to you about it. I thought I would
when we were in the wood alone; then you spoke of my eyes and I thought of my
dear mother. You would have loved her, Basil, and she would have loved you. She
hears me now--yes, she hears and sees me, Basil, and I think she is glad you
came to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am glad too, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Really glad, Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Really glad, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then you will not go away from us?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What makes you ask that?&quot; Her question, tremulously uttered,
formed a pregnant link in the promise he had given her father.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is my dream,&quot; said Annette. &quot;I dreamt it last night, and
it made me sad. You came to say good-bye, and I was unhappy at the thought that
I should never see you again. Basil, if that was to happen I should be sorry you
ever came at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then you wish me to stay?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dearly, Basil, dearly! I thought I would speak to father
about it; then I thought I would speak to you first.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you not speak to your father?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not about my dream; but about your going away, yes. I asked
him to persuade you to stop with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because, Annette----&quot; he said, and paused. &quot;Because I love
you, Basil. I told father so, and he said he loved you, too, and that he wished
he had a son like you. Then you would be my brother, and I should be very happy.
But father said he was afraid you intended to leave us soon, and that made me
dream, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Annette, listen to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am listening, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your father has spoken to me, and that is why I was so late
in coming to you. He asked me to remain here, and I promised him I would.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You did? Oh, Basil!&quot; Her voice expressed the most perfect
joy. She had risen in her excitement, and was now leaning towards him, her lips
parted, her eyes glowing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Annette, I promised him, and I promise you. For some
years at least we will live together.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She threw her arms round his neck, and kissed him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That will be for ever, Basil. You have made me do happy, so
happy!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So that is all settled,&quot; he said. &quot;But I shall be a tyrant,
Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't mind, Basil; I will be very good and obedient. Do you
hear, Bruno, do you hear?&quot; She knelt and kissed the faithful dog, and pressed
his head to her bosom. &quot;Basil is not going away. He will remain here
forever--for ever!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil was very grateful for the little maid's affection,
grateful that his lines had fallen in such pleasant places. What more could man
desire? But there was a shadow gathering and swiftly approaching which neither
of them could see.</p>

<p class="normal">They stopped out later than usual that evening, and when they
returned to the house Annette was radiant.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil has promised to remain with us, father,&quot; she said, in a
voice of great joy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has told you, then, dear child?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, father, yes. He will stop with us for ever. I don't wish
for anything now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The three happy beings sat together in the verandah during the
few brief minutes that divided day and night. In those latitudes there is but
little twilight, and the long peaceful rest of an English sunset is unknown. For
a few moments the brilliancy was dazzling. Great clouds of amethyst and ruby
spread over the western skies, melting soon into sombre shades of purple and
crimson. Then the sun dipped down and disappeared, and the skies were overspread
with a veil of faded gold, behind which the white stars glittered.</p>

<p class="normal">Their souls were in harmony with the spiritual influence of
the lovely scene, and there was an ineffable peace in their hearts. Annette
kissed Basil before she retired to rest, and whispered: &quot;Brother Basil, I shall
have happier dreams to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He kissed her tenderly, and bade her good-night. Unclouded
happiness shone in her eyes as she stole to her room, where she knelt by her
bedside, and uttered the name of Basil in her prayers.</p>

<p class="normal">Anthony Bidaud gazed at his daughter till she entered the
house, and even then kept his eyes fixed upon the door through which she had
disappeared.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is years,&quot; he said to Basil, &quot;since I have felt so
thoroughly content as I do to-night. Come to my room early in the morning; I
shall not write to my lawyer till then, and I wish you to see the letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Shortly after all the inmates of the house were asleep.</p>

<br>
<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">And while they slept, there walked across the distant plains
towards the plantation, a man and a woman who had had that goal in view for
three months past. It was summer when they left their home across the seas. It
was summer when they reached the land to which the woman had been summoned. But,
judging from their faces, no summer errand was theirs.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Walk quicker,&quot; said the man, surlily. &quot;We must get there
before sunrise. My heart is bent upon it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am fit to drop,&quot; said the woman. &quot;How much farther have we
to go?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;According to information, fifteen miles. Walk quicker,
quicker! Have you travelled so far to faint at the last moment? Remember we have
not a penny left to purchase food, and have already fasted too many hours. I see
visions of ease and comfort, of wine and food, ay, and of riches too. I am eager
to get at them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you remember,&quot; said the woman, &quot;that you were not bidden
to come?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What of that?&quot; retorted the man. &quot;I have my tale ready. Leave
me to play my part. Our days of poverty are over. This is the last of them. Walk
quicker, quicker!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_05" href="#div1Ref_05">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">A little after sunrise Basil was awake and out, hastening to
the river for his morning bath. He had slept well and soundly, but he had had
vivid dreams. The events of the day had sunk deep in his mind; it would have
been strange otherwise, for they had altered the currents of his whole future
life. They had furnished him with a secure and happy home; they had placed him
in a position of responsibility which he hailed with satisfaction and a sense of
justifiable pride; moreover, they had assured him that he had won the affection
of a kind and generous gentleman and of a sweet-tempered and gentle little maid.
He was no longer an outcast; he was no longer alone in the world.</p>

<p class="normal">Until this void was supplied he had not felt it. Young,
buoyant, and with a fund of animal spirits which was the secret of his cheerful
nature, sufficient for the day had been the good thereof; but now quite suddenly
an unexpected and sweetly serious duty had been offered to him, and he had
accepted it. He would perform it faithfully and conscientiously.</p>

<p class="normal">Every word Anthony Bidaud had spoken to him had impressed
itself upon his mind. He could have repeated their conversation almost word for
word. It was this which had inspired his dreams, which formed, as it were, a
panorama of the present and the future.</p>

<p class="normal">Annette as she was at this moment, a child, appeared to him
and he lived over again their delightful rambles; for although it was but
yesterday that they were enjoyed, the duty he had taken upon himself seemed to
send them far back into the past; but still Annette was a child, and her sunny
ways belonged to childhood. The story of &quot;Paul and Virginia&quot; had been a
favourite with him when he was a youngster, and his dreams at first were touched
by the colour of that simple tale. The life he had lived these last few weeks on
Anthony Bidaud's plantation favoured the resemblance: the South Sea Islanders
who worked on the land, the waterfalls, the woods, the solitudes, the protecting
bond which linked him to Annette--all formed in his sleeping fancies a companion
idyll to the charming creation of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. He carried Annette
over the river, he wandered with her through the shadows of the mountains, they
were lost and found, they sat together under the shade of the velvet
sunflower-tree; and in this part of his dreams he himself was a youth and not a
man.</p>

<p class="normal">So much for the present, and it was due to his light heart and
the happiness he had found that his dreams did not take the colour of the
subsequent tragedy which brought the lives of these woodland children to their
sad and pathetic end. His future and Annette's was brighter than that of Paul
and Virginia. He beheld her as a woman, and he was still her protector. She
represented the beauty of the entire world of thought and action. Her figure was
faultless, her face most lovely, her movements gracefully perfect. There are
countenances upon which an eternal cloud appears to rest, and which even when
they smile are not illumined. Upon Annette's countenance rested an eternal
sunshine, and this quality of light irradiated not only all surrounding visible
objects, but all hopes and feelings of the heart. When Basil awoke these
felicitous fancies were not obliterated or weakened, as most such fancies are in
waking moments, and as he walked towards the river they lightened his footsteps
and made him glad. Wending his way along a cattle track dotted with gum-trees,
he saw beneath the branches of one a woman whose face was strange to him. She
was not English born, and as she reclined in an attitude of fatigue against the
tree's trunk there was about her an air of exhaustion which stirred Basil to
compassion for her apparently forlorn condition. He remembered his own days and
nights of weary tramping through the bush, and, pausing, he looked down upon
her, and she peered up at him through her half-closed lids.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it?&quot; she asked, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning. To me it is a bad morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil looked round. The heavens were luminous with vivid
colour, the birds were flying busily to and from their nests, nature's myriad
pulses throbbed with gladness. To him it was the best, the brightest of days.
But this sad woman before him was pale and worn; there were traces not only of
exhaustion but of hunger in her face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are hungry,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't mock me,&quot; said the woman, in no gracious tone; &quot;let me
rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you follow this track,&quot; persisted Basil, &quot;the way I have
come, you will see the Home Station. They will give you breakfast there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the woman appeared inclined to accept his
kindness she made a movement upwards, but almost immediately she relinquished
her intention.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I will wait.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was loth to leave her in her distressful plight, but her
churlish manner was discouraging.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you not let me help you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can help me,&quot; said the woman, &quot;by leaving me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had no alternative. &quot;If you think better of it,&quot; he said,
&quot;you can obtain shelter and food at the Home Station.&quot; Then he passed on to the
river.</p>

<p class="normal">A stranger was there, already stripping for the purpose of
bathing. Scarcely looking at him, Basil was about to remove to a more retired
spot when he observed something in the water which caused him to run to the man,
who was removing his last garment, and seize his arm.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What for?&quot; demanded the stranger.</p>

<p class="normal">He spoke fairly good English, as did the woman who had
declined his assistance, but with a foreign accent. He was brown, and thin, and
wrinkled, and Basil saw at once that he was not an Englishman.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I presume you have not breakfasted yet,&quot; was Basil's
apparently inconsequential answer to the question.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not yet,&quot; said the stranger impatiently, shaking himself free
from Basil's grasp. &quot;Why do you stop me? Is not the river free?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite free,&quot; said Basil; &quot;but instead of eating you may be
eaten.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He pointed downwards, and leaning forward the stranger beheld
a huge alligator lurking beneath a thin thicket of reeds. The brute was
perfectly motionless, but all its voracious senses were on the alert.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ugh!&quot; cried the stranger, beginning to dress hurriedly. &quot;That
would be a bad commencement of my business.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He did not say &quot;thank you,&quot; nor make the slightest
acknowledgment of the service Basil had rendered him. This jarred upon the young
man, who stood watching him get into his clothes. They were ragged and
travel-stained, and the stranger's physical condition was evidently none of the
best; but his eyes were keen, and all his intellectual forces were awake. In
this respect Basil found an odd resemblance in him to the alligator waiting for
prey in the waving reeds beneath, and also a less odd resemblance to the woman
he had left lying in the shadow of the gum-trees.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have business here, then?&quot; asked the young man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have--important business. Understand that I answer simply
to prove that I am not an intruder.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I understand. Is the woman I met on my way a relative of
yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What woman?&quot; cried the stranger, in sharp accents. &quot;Like you
in face, and bearing about her signs of hard travel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did she speak to you? Why do you question me about her? By
what right?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is no particular right in question that I can see?&quot;
said Basil. &quot;I spoke to her as I am speaking to you, and asked if I could serve
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And she!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was as uncivil as yourself, and declined my offer of
assistance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She acted well. We are not beggars. For my incivility, that
is how you take it. You misconstrue me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am glad to hear it. You seem tired.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have been walking all day and all night, and all day and
all night again, for more days and nights than I care to count I have done
nothing but walk, walk, walk, since my arrival at this world's end.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you but just arrived?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, but just arrived, wearied and worn out with nothing but
walking, walking, walking. Is that what this world's end was made for?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">If the stranger had not Stated that he had important business
to transact, and had there not been something superior in his speech and
deportment to the ordinary tramp with whom every man in the Australian colonies
is familiar, Basil would have set him down as a member of that delectable
fraternity. Notwithstanding this favourable opinion, however, Basil took an
instinctive dislike to the man. He had seen in him an odd likeness to the
alligator, and brief as had been their interview up to this point, he had gone
the length of mentally comparing him now to a fox, now to a jackal--to any
member of the brute species indeed whose nature was distinguished by the
elements of rapacity and cunning.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you far to go?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No farther,&quot; replied the stranger, with an upward glance at
Anthony Bidaud's house, one end of which was visible from the spot upon which
they were conversing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is that your destination?&quot; inquired Basil, observing the
upward glance.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That,&quot; said the stranger, with a light laugh, &quot;is my
destination, if I have not been misinformed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The laugh intensified Basil's dislike; there was a mocking
sinister ring in it, but he nevertheless continued the conversation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Misinformed in what respect?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is M. Bidaud's house?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is M. Bidaud's house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;M. Anthony Bidaud?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Originally from Switzerland.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil's hazard of the stranger's precise nationality now took
definite form.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As you are,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As I am,&quot; said the stranger, &quot;and as Anthony Bidaud is.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are right in your surmise. He is from Switzerland.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My surmise? Ah? He has a fine estate here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But his wife--she is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is so, unhappily.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is one man's meat is another man's poison--a proverb
that may be reversed.&quot; His small eyes glittered, and his thin pointed features
seemed all to converge to one point. (&quot;Fox, decidedly,&quot; thought Basil.) The
stranger continued. &quot;His health, is it good?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In the light of Anthony Bidaud's revelation on the previous
evening this was a startling question, and Basil answered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is an inquiry you had best make of himself if you are
likely to see him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is more than likely that I shall see him,&quot; said the
stranger, &quot;and he will tell me. He has but one child.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are well informed. He has but one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whose name is Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whose name,&quot; said Basil, wondering from what source the
stranger had obtained his information, &quot;is Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Charming, charming, charming,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;Everything
is charming, except&quot;--with a loathing gesture at the alligator, which lay still
as a log, waiting for prey--&quot;that monster; except also that I am dead with
fatigue. I came here for a bath to refresh myself after much travelling. Is
there any part of this treacherous river in which a man may bathe in safety?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will show you a place.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No tricks, young sir, said the stranger, suspicion in his
voice.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why should I play you tricks? If you do not care to trust me,
seek a secure spot yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I will accompany you, who must know the river well. You
do, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am thoroughly acquainted with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You guessed my nation; shall I guess yours? Australian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am an Englishman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A great nation; a great people. Is this the spot?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They had arrived at a smooth piece of water, semi-circularly
protected by rocks from the invasion of alligators.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is the spot,&quot; said Basil, &quot;you will be perfectly safe
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The water was so clear that they could see to the bottom.
Black and silver bream, perch, mullet, and barramundi were swimming in its
translucent depths. The stranger peered carefully among the rocks to make sure
that they were free from foes, and then, without thanking Basil, began to strip
off his clothes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you--where will you bathe?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A little farther up stream. Good morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, good morning; but I may see you again if you are living
near.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I live,&quot; said Basil, &quot;in the house yonder.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_06" href="#div1Ref_06">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">A sudden excitement was observable in the stranger. He paused
in his undressing, and laid his hand on Basil's arm, clutching with nervous
fingers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are very intimate with M. Anthony Bidaud?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We are friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Friends? Ah! You are not related? No, you cannot be, for you
are English. Yet there are other ties. His wife is dead, you say, and as I know.
Yes, dead. But he may be looking for another, may be already married again.&quot; He
spoke in feverish haste. (&quot;A touch of the jackal here,&quot; thought Basil.) &quot;Tell
me, you friend of M. Anthony Bidaud.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is not married again,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and to my knowledge is
not seeking another wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The stranger drew a long breath of relief, followed
immediately by the exhibition of a new suspicion. &quot;His daughter, Annette--if he
spoke truth a child. But men lie sometimes, very often, you, I, all men. He
married long, long ago, and this Annette may well be a young woman of twenty.&quot;
He scowled as he looked at Basil's handsome face. &quot;Is she married, or going to
be?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Absurd,&quot; said Basil, but a little touch of colour came into
his face which the sharp eyes of the stranger noted, &quot;she is scarcely fourteen
years of age.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good, good. Time, let us hope, to prevent mischief. But,
pardon me, if you live in the house of M. Bidaud, there must be a reason. You do
not look like a common labourer; you are something better, a gentleman--eh?&quot; And
again all his thin pointed features seemed, foxlike, to converge to one point.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am a gentleman,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and I am staying with M.
Bidaud as a guest.&quot; He referred to the present, not feeling warranted in
speaking of the future. The arrangement he had entered into with Anthony Bidaud
had yet to be carried into effect.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, ah, as a guest, only as a guest, but with an eye to the
future, perhaps. M. Anthony Bidaud is rich, and in two years his daughter, his
only child, will be sixteen and nearly ripe. There is a saying, is there not,
among you English that welcomes the coming and speeds the parting guest? I have
been in your country, and know something of its literature, and in my own land
my education was not neglected. That saying about the coming and parting guest
is a good omen, for I have but just arrived, and you----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But Basil did not wait to hear the conclusion of the sentence.
Annoyed at the turn the conversation had taken he turned on his heel, and left
the stranger to enjoy his bath. He walked slowly to his own, rather ruffled by
the interview.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who can he be?&quot; he thought, as he prepared for his swim. &quot;He
seems to be acquainted with M. Bidaud and with his personal history. What on
earth made me answer his interminable questions? His pertinacity, I suppose, and
a kind of magnetism in him which it was hard to resist. But I might have been
courteous without being communicative. I said nothing, however, of my own
prompting, and his questions followed each other naturally. What he learnt from
me he could have learnt from a dozen others, and after all there is no harm
done. He certainly has the knack of rubbing the wrong way; an extraordinarily
annoying fellow, but neither loutish nor ignorant. That is why I was constrained
to follow his lead. This is his destination; his business then, must be with M.
Bidaud. Important business, he said--and with Annette's father. I did not like
his references to Annette. Will it be right or wrong for me to convey my
impressions of this stranger to M. Bidaud? Wrong. I will merely mention that I
met with such a man, who was coming to the house upon business. He spoke of
having walked a long way. He must be poor, or he would have chosen another mode
of conveyance, especially as he seems to be in somewhat feverish haste. Being
poor is nothing against him; I am poor myself. Psha! What a worry I am making of
nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He could not dismiss the subject, however, and the currents of
his thoughts ran on even as he swam.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The woman I met on my way to the river; how skilfully he
evaded my inquiries as to the relationship between them! His tone when he spoke
of her showed that he had power over her. I have not the least doubt he is the
kind of man who can make himself intensely disagreeable. Poor woman! There is a
resemblance in their features; I have heard that husband and wife frequently
grow like each other in face. She was hungry, but she declined the offer of a
good meal. Acting, I should say, under her husband's instructions, and too
frightened of him to disobey him. Faithful creatures, women. Patient as camels
some of them and as docile. A hard tramp she seems to have had of it, and he has
not spared her. Well, she can rest here a few days. Would I like them to remain
on the plantation? No. He would keep me in a continual state of irritation. His
allusions to Annette were in the worst of taste. I dare say before the day is
out I shall know the nature of his business. M. Bidaud will tell me. Confound
the fellow! I'll not think of him any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As a contribution towards this end he plunged half a dozen
times into the deepest parts of the river, and finally emerged, glowing. The
disturbing impressions produced by the stranger were dissipated, and Basil
thought it would look churlish if on his road back to the house he did not go to
see whether he could be of any service to him. He saw nothing, however, of the
man or the woman, and greatly refreshed, he proceeded to the house. The sun was
now high in the heavens, and the labourers were at work on the plantation. He
exchanged greetings with a few of the better sort, and inquired whether they had
seen anything of the strangers. They replied in the negative; they had seen
nothing of them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you, Rocke?&quot; he asked of one who was regarding him with
a scowl.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Rocke. &quot;What business is it of mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was Rocke's misfortune to always wear a scowl on his face,
but in this scowl there were degrees. To produce an amiable smile was with Rocke
an impossibility; nature had been cruel, and his parents, one or both of them,
had transmitted to him a sour temper as an inheritance; but the state of his
feelings could be correctly judged by the kind of scowl he wore; a nice observer
could scarcely make a mistake as to whether he tolerated, disliked, or hated the
man he was gazing on. There could be no mistake made now; he hated Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">There was a reason. Every man has his good points, even the
worst of men, and Rocke's good point was that he conscientiously performed the
duties for which he was engaged. However hard the work before him, done it was
with a will--and a scowl. Now, this was a distinct virtue, and Anthony Bidaud
gave him credit for it, and appreciated the conscientious worker, as any other
master would do of a man who gave him full value for his wage. So far, so good;
master and man were satisfied. But before Basil's arrival on the plantation
Rocke had got it into his head--which was not an intellectual head--that Anthony
Bidaud entertained the notion of creating a general supervisor and manager of
the estate, and that he, Rocke, was the man to be appointed; and since Basil's
arrival his ambitious dream was disturbed by the conviction that Basil would
step into the shoes he wished to wear.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't know that it is any business of yours,&quot; said Basil to
Rocke, &quot;only I thought you might have seen these persons.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, I haven't,&quot; said Rocke.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil nodded cheerfully, and proceeded towards the house. He
was not a man of paroxysms; except upon very special occasions his temperament
was equable. As to whether Rocke had spoken the truth or no he did not
speculate; it was not in Rocke he was interested, but in the man and woman with
whom he had spoken on his way to the river.</p>

<p class="normal">Anthony Bidaud was an early riser, and Basil went to the room
in which the master of the plantation was in the habit of transacting his
private business. He knocked twice or thrice at the door without receiving an
answer, and then, turning the handle, he entered the room.</p>

<p class="normal">Anthony Bidaud was reclining in the chair in which he usually
sat when engaged in correspondence. His back was towards Basil, and before him
on the table writing materials were spread. He sat quite still, and for a moment
or two the young man was uncertain what to do. Then he called Bidaud by name. No
answer came, and Basil, surprised at the stillness, advanced to Bidaud, and
stood immediately behind him. Still no notice was taken of Basil. Then he laid
his hand upon Bidaud's shoulder. The occupant of the chair did not move, and
Basil leaned anxiously forward to look into his face. At first Basil believed
him to be asleep, but a closer examination sent the blood rushing to the young
man's heart in terror. Bidaud's arm hung listlessly by his side, and upon his
face dwelt an expression of acute suffering. Again Basil called him by name, and
shook him roughly, but no responsive word or movement greeted him from the quiet
figure in the chair. Basil thrust his hand into Bidaud's shirt over the region
of his heart, and trembled to meet with no pulsation there. He raised Bidaud's
arm and released it. It dropped lifeless down.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Merciful heavens!&quot; cried Basil, looking helplessly around.
&quot;Can this be death?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The question he asked of himself was heard by another man. The
stranger he had met on the banks of the river had noiselessly opened the door,
and now advanced to the chair.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who speaks of death?&quot; asked the stranger. &quot;Ah, it is you, who
are a guest in this house. And I find you and him &quot;--he stretched a long bony
finger at the recumbent figure of Anthony Bidaud--&quot;here together, alone. You
with a face of fear, terror, and excitement; he quite still, quite still!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was perfectly composed, and there was a malicious smile on
his lips as he confronted Basil. Dazed by the situation, Basil could find no
words to reply.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are confounded,&quot; continued the stranger. &quot;It needs
explanation. Who is this man sitting so quietly in his chair?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;M. Anthony Bidaud,&quot; said Basil, with white lips, &quot;the master
of this house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, M. Anthony Bidaud, the master of this house,&quot; said the
stranger, echoing Basil's words, but whereas Basil's voice was agitated, his had
not a tremor in it. &quot;I will see if you are speaking the truth.&quot; He lowered his
face, and his eyes rested upon the face of the motionless figure. &quot;Yes, it is
he, Anthony Bidaud, worn, alas! and wasted. Sad, sad, sad!&quot; Grief was expressed
in the words but not in the tone of the speaker. &quot;What was it you asked a moment
ago? Can this be death? I am a doctor. I will tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Lifting the lifeless form in his arms he laid it upon a couch,
and tearing open the shirt and waistcoat, placed his ear to Anthony Bidaud's
heart; then took his pulse between finger and thumb. He proceeded with his
examination by taking from his pocket a little leather case containing a small
comb and a narrow slip of looking-glass. Rubbing the surface of the glass dry
with a handkerchief that had dropped to the ground, he passed it over the mouth
of Anthony Bidaud; then held it up to the light.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, looking Basil full in the face, &quot;it is death.
It is lucky I travelled hither in the night, and did not allow myself to be
delayed by fatigue. Fortune, I thank you. You have treated me scurvily hitherto;
at length you relent, and smile upon me. Being a lady, I kiss my hand to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">There was something so inexpressibly heartless in the action
that Basil cried indignantly, &quot;Who are you, and by what right have you intruded
yourself into this room?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The stranger did not immediately reply. He felt in his pocket
for a snuff-box, and producing it regaled himself with a pinch. He offered the
box to Basil, who pushed it aside. He smiled and placed the box in his pocket,
and was also about to replace the leather case, when an amusing thought occurred
to him. He dressed his hair with the comb, and gazed at himself in the glass
with an affectation of vanity. His smile broadened as he noticed the look of
horror in Basil's face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You wish to know,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;who I am, and by what
right I intrude myself into this room. You have presumption, you, M. Anthony
Bidaud's guest, to use the word 'intrude' to me! I am this dead gentleman's
brother. My name is Gilbert Bidaud. Eh? Did you speak?&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_07" href="#div1Ref_07">CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">So many conflicting emotions had been pressed into the last
few minutes that Basil was utterly bewildered. The cold, sardonic face before
him, wreathed into mocking smiles even in the presence of death, added to his
bewilderment. He passed his hand across his eyes, wondering whether he was
dreaming, but removing his hand from his forehead he saw the dead form of
Anthony Bidaud on the sofa, and heard the light laugh of the man who called
himself Anthony's brother. This laugh recalled him to himself; he was in full
possession of his senses, and understood what had occurred, and to some extent
what it portended.</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud! And the woman with him was not his wife, but
his sister, to whom Annette's father had written six months ago, imploring her
to come to him, and promising to provide for her and her family. That being so,
she was here by authority. She was but an instrument in the hands of Gilbert
Bidaud, whose lightest word she was constrained to obey.</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is hard to speak harshly of one's flesh and blood, but it
is the truth that the girl I loved was fortunate in not placing her affections
upon him. He would have broken her heart. He was a spendthrift and a libertine,
and would stop at little for the gratification of his selfish pleasures.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was but last evening that these words were spoken by lips
that would never speak again, and now this spendthrift and libertine was within
touch of him, was standing with a smiling face by the dead body of the brother
he would have wronged. There came to Basil's mind the image of Annette, the
sweet confiding girl, who was to have been given into his care to guard and
protect. All that was over now. Inexorable death had stopped the fulfilment of
the fond father's wish. And Annette herself, how would it fare with her? She was
ignorant as yet of the crushing, terrible blow which had so suddenly fallen upon
her. Who would impart the cruel news to her? Who would comfort her in her
bereavement? Even as these reflections crossed his mind he heard the young
girl's voice singing outside as she tripped downstairs from her bedroom. He
glided to the door, and softly turned the key. Just in time. Annette lingered at
the door, tried the handle gently with the intention of kissing her father
good-morning, and, finding the door fast, passed on gaily and continued her
song.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is Annette?&quot; questioned Gilbert Bidaud. Basil nodded. &quot;A
sweet voice, the voice of a child, whose nature is not yet moulded. We will
mould it, my sister and I. We will instil into her virgin soul, principles. She
will be grateful that we have come, being of her blood. I have a number of your
English sayings at my fingers' ends. Blood is thicker than water. I represent
the one, you the other. She is not a woman--yet. The mind of a child is like a
slate! fancies, likings, are easily rubbed off. It is more serious when we grow
older. The child forgets, the woman remembers. Do you catch my meaning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should be sorry to say I did,&quot; replied Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, you would pay me a compliment, gilding me with virtues to
which I do not aspire, to which I have never aspired. I am a plain man, I;
honest to the backbone; with my heart on my sieve, transparent. It has not paid
up to this time, but my hour has come. Why did you lock the door?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Does not that answer you?&quot; pointing to the dead body of
Annette's father.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, she does not know. You are considerate, you.&quot; A strange
smile came to his lips as he added, &quot;No one knows but you and I.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil stepped to the table. Perhaps the letter which Anthony
Bidaud intended to write to his lawyer was there; it might contain something by
which he could be guided at this dread crisis. But the sheet of paper which
Anthony Bidaud had taken from the open desk displayed only the mark of a scrawl
at the top. The pen, with the ink scarcely dried in it, lay upon the table.
Evidently at the very moment that Anthony Bidaud had put pen to paper he was
visited by the death-stroke. The pen had dropped from his fingers, and he had
fallen back lifeless in his chair. There was, however, an addressed envelope,
and Basil noted the name and the direction, which were those of the lawyer whom
Anthony Bidaud intended to summon to the plantation.</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud had followed his movements attentively, and
now, when Basil looked up from the table, he repeated the last words he had
uttered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No one knows but you and I.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; demanded Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What I mean,&quot; said Bidaud, touching his forehead with a
finger, &quot;I keep here for the present. It is sometimes dangerous to explain
meanings too soon. Take heed. When I came to this colony--but a short time
since--I was inwardly warned that I might meet with men from whom it would be
necessary to protect myself. Therefore I purchased this&quot;--producing a
revolver--&quot;and this&quot;--producing a knife--&quot;only to be used in self-defence,
against you, against any man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">There was nothing menacing in his tone. He spoke, indeed,
rather playfully than otherwise, and handled the revolver and knife as though
they were toys instead of dangerous weapons. A wild thought crossed Basil's
mind, and he acted upon it instantly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You say you are Gilbert Bidaud, brother of this unfortunate
gentleman, but I have only your word for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, ah,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, with an air of great amusement,
&quot;you have only my word for it. But what kind of authority do you hold here that
you should demand answers to questions upon this or any other subject?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil could not answer this direct challenge; he inwardly
recognised the weakness of his position; Anthony Bidaud dead, he was but a
cipher on his estate.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are as a feather to a rock,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, with a
gesture of contempt, &quot;and I am but amusing myself with you. I stand quietly here
for a reason I may presently explain. This house has lost a master.&quot; He glanced
at his dead brother. &quot;This house has gained a master.&quot; He touched his breast
triumphantly. &quot;It is but a change, a law of nature. My brother and I have not
met for twenty years. He had a good motive for avoiding me; he fled from
Switzerland with money of mine, and now, through death, he is compelled to make
restitution.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is false,&quot; cried Basil, chivalrously defending the friend
he had lost. &quot;If you are Gilbert Bidaud it was you who attempted to rob him of
his inheritance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, ah. Did my estimable brother open his heart entirely to
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sufficiently to reveal your true character--even to the last
words you spoke to him before he left Switzerland.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Favour me with them. It may be excused if I do not faithfully
recall them at this distance of time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'One day,' you said to him 'I will be even with you. Remember
my words--dead or alive, I will be even with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I remember. My words were prophetic. Fate was on my side,
justice was on my side. They whispered to me, 'Wait.' I waited. And now--look
there! So, so, my ingenious young friend; you know the whole story.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was related to me by your brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By this lump of clay! It would be the act of a fool to deal
tenderly by you; and I, as you may have already learned, am no fool. How came my
brother by his death?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How came he by his death?&quot; stammered Basil, puzzled by the
question, and not seeing the drift of it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay, how came he by his death? I am not so ignorant as you
suppose. I have made inquiries about you; there are men on this estate who bear
you no good will. You are here, not as a guest, but an interloper. You and my
brother were strangers a few short weeks ago, and you forced yourself upon him
and lived here, a beggar, eating his food, drinking his wine, and paying for
them neither in service nor money. That is a creditable part to be played by one
who calls himself an English gentleman. Summoned here by M. Anthony Bidaud--I
have in my pocket the letter he wrote to our sister--I hasten on the wings of
love, tarrying not on the road, but wearing myself near to death in order that I
may satisfy his longing desire to embrace me. I meet you by accident on the
river's bank, and I perceive that you regard yourself as master here. The river
is yours, the land is yours, my brother is yours, his daughter Annette is
yours--ah, you wince at that. All this you proclaim in your lordly way, and
patronise me--me, whose rightful place you would have usurped. Before meeting
you pass my sister, resting in her labour of love, and you offer her
charity--you, a beggar, pass this insult upon a lady who, under my direction,
will educate my dear brother's little daughter, and teach her--principles. You
leave me by the river; I, guileless, unsuspicious, a child in innocence, calmly
take my bath, and reflect with delight upon the joy of my brother when he takes
me to his arms. Walking to this house, I meet a labourer, whose name is Rocke.
He tells me something of you; he directs me to my brother's private room. I open
the door; I see you standing by my brother's side. You are in a state of fear
and agitation; your face is white, your limbs tremble. I hear you ask the
question, 'Can this be death?' To whom or to what do you address this enquiry?
To your conscience, for you believe yourself to be alone; you are unconscious
that I am present 'Can this be death?' I convince myself, and you. It <i>is</i>
death. I am deprived of the opportunity of saying to my brother that I forgive
him for the wrong he did me in the past. It is most cruel, and you have robbed
me of the opportunity; but, before I forget it, I will chance the efficacy of my
forgiveness, though he be dead.&quot; With a mock humility shocking to witness, he
extended his hands, and, looking upwards, said, &quot;Brother, I forgive you. I
return to my argument. What passed between you and my brother before I entered
this room? Again I ask, how came he by his death! If it is not a natural end,
who is the murderer?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In hot indignation Basil started forward, but by a great
effort of will restrained himself. He had been appalled by the careless mocking
tone in which Gilbert Bidaud had spoken, by his false assumption of a grief he
did not feel, by the evident enjoyment he derived from the glaring insincerity
of his professions. For no two things could be more distinctly at variance than
Gilbert Bidaud's words and the tone in which he uttered them. It exhibited a
refinement of malice, and, what rendered it more revolting, of malice in which
the intellectual quality was conspicuous.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is well,&quot; continued Gilbert Bidaud, &quot;that you exercise
self-control. I might call aloud for help; I might, in less time than it takes
me to speak it, create in this room the evidences of a struggle, in the course
of which I might fire my revolver, produced for self-defence; I might inform
those who would break the door down--it is locked by you, remember--that you
attempted to murder me, even as you-- Ah, I perceive you understand. Yes, all
this I might do, and you would be in the toils. Do not move until I have done
with you, or you will be in deadly danger. In such parts of the world as this,
exasperated men often proceed hastily to summary justice, and it might be
executed upon you. I am teaching you lessons, as I shall teach my dear niece
Annette, principles. You are young; I, alas, am old. I have nothing to learn;
you have much. Tell me, you hanger-on in this house, you beggar of my brother's
hospitality, what passed between you and him before I entered this room?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied Basil, confounded by the possibilities of a
ruthless malice with which Gilbert Bidaud had threatened him. &quot;I have already
informed you that when I entered the room he was dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What brought you here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I came by appointment,&quot; said Basil. He no longer doubted that
the man before him was Anthony Bidaud's brother; and he was surprised that he
had not detected the resemblance upon his first meeting with Gilbert.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What was the nature of the appointment?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He wished me to read a letter he intended to write to his
lawyer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, ah! He intended to write to his lawyer. May I ask this
lawyer's name?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is there upon an envelope.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His place of residence?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sydney, I believe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A long way off. The letter was to have been written this
morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. He at first intended to write it last night, but he put
it off till to-day. The postponement was most unfortunate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should have urged him to carry out his intention last
night, as he designed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah! <i>Aprs dommage chacun est sage</i>--except the dead.
Why should you have urged him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would have been to my interests--and his, I fear.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Leave his out of the question; he has done with the world.
Yours is another matter. How could a simple letter to a lawyer have been in your
interests? A letter is not a legal document.&quot; His preternatural sharpness as he
made this remark was a revelation to an honest nature like Basil's. There seemed
to be no limit to Gilbert Bidaud's cunning.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At least it would have explained matters, and cleared me from
your suspicions.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Words are easily spoken, and weigh no more than air. To what
effect was to have been this letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He desired to make his will.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud drew a deep breath of satisfaction; he had
elicited something tangible, something which had wonderfully strengthened his
position. &quot;Then there is no will, and the letter, which would have been
valueless, was not written. Your expression of regret leads me to infer that the
will was to have been in your favour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To a certain extent.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;False. He intended to repair the injustice from which I have
so long suffered; his property would have been divided between me and the little
Annette. It is too late for him to do that now; but I stand as natural guardian
to my niece. I am truly the master here; the law will declare me so. Console
yourself. You shall depart from this house a free man. You are not in danger.
Bear witness to my magnanimity; my brother died a natural death. I will testify
it, to save you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That will not do,&quot; said Basil. &quot;From what cause he died shall
be proved by proper evidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall. I, a doctor, will supply it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I reject your proof; you are an interested party. It shall be
independent evidence that shall establish the cause of death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So be it, young Daniel,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, briskly.
&quot;Meanwhile, I release you from suspicion; I, the gentleman you have insulted,
believe you to be innocent. I go to seek my niece, to introduce myself to her,
and to break to her the sad, the melancholy news. But before I go I give you
notice of your discharge. For one week from this day you shall enjoy my
hospitality, but for no longer, for not an hour longer. Accept it, beggar, or
leave at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He paused at the door, opened it, removed the key to the
outside, and with a contemptuous motion, ordered Basil to quit the room. The
young man had no choice but to obey. Whatever might be Gilbert Bidaud's
character, he stood in the house as legal representative of the dead. Annette
was but a child, and her uncle was her lawful guardian. Grieved,
sorrow-stricken, and humiliated, Basil left the room, and heard Gilbert Bidaud
turn the key.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_08" href="#div1Ref_08">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">What should he do now, how should he act? To accept Gilbert
Bidaud's hospitality was impossible. The old man was his bitter enemy, and would
show him no consideration. Indeed, what consideration could he expect? There was
no denying that he had no right to remain on the estate, but he felt he could
not leave it for ever without seeing Annette once more, without speaking to her
perhaps for the last time. Nor could be well take his final departure without
making an attempt to clear himself from the foul suspicions which, in his
absence, he felt convinced Gilbert Bidaud would set in circulation against him.
He had led a spotless life, and the thought that a stain should now be cast upon
it was unbearable. But what means could he take to clear himself from the breath
of slander? He could think of no way at present, and he walked into the open
with a heavy weight of melancholy at his heart.</p>

<p class="normal">He wandered into the woods and gathered some fruit; he had a
vigorous appetite, and it would be a folly to starve himself. But the food of
which he partook had never tasted less sweet than on this sad morning. His
hunger appeased, he returned to the vicinity of the house.</p>

<p class="normal">He heard a cry of distress in the distance, and saw men and
women hurrying to the spot from which the cry proceeded. The voice was
Annette's.</p>

<p class="normal">Presently he saw the men and women coming towards the house.
They were headed by Gilbert Bidaud and his sister, and one of the men--before
the group came close to him he saw that it was Rocke--was carrying in his arms
the insensible form of Annette. Impelled by love and infinite compassion for the
child, he started forward, but was haughtily waved off by Gilbert Bidaud.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That man,&quot; said Gilbert to those in his rear, &quot;has my
permission to remain on this estate for one week. When that time has expired he
will be a trespasser.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he finished speaking Annette opened her eyes--they fell
upon Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil, Basil!&quot; she cried, extending her arms to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Annette!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Once more he attempted to go to her; once more Gilbert Bidaud
waved him off, and stepped before him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If he touches her, if he follows her, arrest him. I give you
authority.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil fell back. Annette's mournful eyes were fixed upon his
face in dumb despair.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hurry in--hurry in,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud in a harsh tone.</p>

<p class="normal">They passed into the house, and Basil was left alone. It was a
favourite trick of his to put his thoughts into unspoken words; he had
encouraged the habit, finding it led to clearness and generally, when he was in
doubt, to some definite issue. In his disturbed mood he found this a suitable
time for this mental indulgence. Something should be done, clearly; but what?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Poor Annette!&quot; he thought. &quot;Poor child! What will now become
of her? What will be her future? That brute--he is no less--who boasts so
sardonically that he intends to teach her principles, will poison her mind
against me. If I do not see her again she will grow to hate me. It is dreadful
to think of. She has none but kind thoughts of me now; and though in a short
time we may be parted for ever, and all chance of ever seeing her again will be
lost, I should dearly like to feel that if she thinks of me in the future it
will be with gentleness and affection. I have done nothing to forfeit her
affection, except that I am unfortunate.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My bright dreams are suddenly snapped. A few short hours have
changed happiness to woe. Still--still I have committed no wrong. Of that I am
sure, and it is a comfort--but poor Annette! If I could assure her that I am not
to blame, I could bear it. She would believe me, and I could go on my way with a
less sorrowful heart.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That brute will try his hardest to prevent my seeing her. The
blow that has fallen upon her may prostrate her. She may die--it is horrible,
horrible! If that should happen, Gilbert Bidaud will come into possession of
everything. Is that the end to which he will work? He is capable of it, capable
of any villainy. Can I do nothing to save her?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am powerless. I have no claim upon her; I have no right to
be here. But I will not go away without seeing, without speaking to her. If he
takes her from this place, which is likely enough, I will follow them. She must
not, she must not be left to the tender mercies of that jackal.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All very fine to talk, Basil. You will follow them? Why, man,
you must live. It is a necessity. And to live you must work. How much money have
you in your pocket to commence the fight of existence with?--to say nothing of
the grand things you are going to do for sweet Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has got hold of my heart-strings. I shall never, never
forget her. Certain words spoken by my dear friend, Anthony Bidaud, last night,
come to my mind. Let me recall them, exactly as he spoke them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We are drawn to each other,' he said. And before that: 'By
accident you enter into our lives. I use the term accident, but I believe it to
be a providence.' How if it should be so? The shadow of death was hanging over
him, and at such times some men have been gifted with prophetic insight. If it
were so with Anthony Bidaud, this is not the end. The thought I have expressed,
the very word 'insight' I have used, were his. 'I have observed you closely,' he
said, 'and am satisfied to deliver into your hands a sacred charge, the charge
of a young girl's future. At such moments as these there comes to some men a
subtle, unfathomable insight. It comes to me. I firmly believe that there is a
link between you and my child, which, if you do not recognise it now, you will
be bound to recognise in the future. It may be broken in the present, but the
threads will be joined as surely as we stand here side by side.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With all my heart I hope so, but it is the wildest, the most
unreasonable of hopes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can nothing, nothing be done?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He said he had made no will; but he may have left papers
expressing his wishes. How to get a sight of them? If I had sufficient means to
take me to Sydney I would hasten there, to Anthony Bidaud's lawyer, and lay the
case before him. But my purse is empty. I have, however, something about me of
value. My gold watch and chain, given to me by my dear father. That is worth a
certain sum, but it would not carry me to Sydney. It would carry me, however, to
Gum Flat, where perhaps I can find a lawyer who will advise her. In the saddle I
could reach there to-night, and be back to-morrow. Where can I obtain a horse? I
dare not take one from the plantation. Gilbert Bidaud would accuse me of theft,
and he would be within his right. Ah! Old Corrie!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Here he stopped. His unspoken thoughts had led him to a
definite issue.</p>

<p class="normal">Gum Flat was the name of the nearest township, if township it
could be called. In the Australian colonies they delight in singular names for
places. Old Corrie was a man who, by permission of Anthony Bidaud, occupied a
hut which he had built with his own hands on the plantation, some two miles from
the spot upon which Basil at that moment stood. He was not employed on the
estate, but did odd jobs in wood splitting and the felling of trees for the
master of the plantation. The man had &quot;taken&quot; to Basil, as the saying is, and in
his odd way had shown a liking for the young man, who always had a pleasant word
for any agreeable person he chanced to fall across.</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie was not an old man, his age being about forty, but
he was dubbed Old Corrie because he was angular, because he was crooked, because
he had a mouth all awry, because he chose to keep himself from his fellows. He
owned a horse, and it occurred to Basil that he might lend it to him for the
journey to Gum Flat, which was distant some forty-five miles. To Old Corrie's
hut, therefore, Basil betook himself, stepping out with a will.</p>

<p class="normal">In less than half-an-hour he reached the old fellow's
dwelling. Old Corrie was not at home, but Basil heard the sound of his axe in
the woods. It was not very near, but men's ears get trained to fine sounds in
the bush. Guided by the thud of the axe Basil in a short time found himself face
to face with the woodman.</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie went on with his work, merely glancing up and
giving Basil a friendly nod. From another living creature Basil received a more
boisterous greeting, a laughing jackass which Old Corrie had tamed bursting into
an outrageous fit of laughter without the least apparent cause. This bird, which
is sometimes called the bushman's clock, was an uncouth-looking object, as big
as a crow, of a rich chestnut-brown colour with light-blue wings; its beak was
long and pointed, and its mouth inordinately large. These characteristics, in
alliance with a formidable crest, invested it with a ferocious air; but this
particular specimen was exceedingly gentle despite the extravagant sounds it
emitted, which might have been excruciatingly prolonged had not its sharp eye
caught sight of a carpet snake wriggling through the underwood. Down darted the
laughing jackass, and commenced a battle with the snake which terminated in the
bird throwing the dead body of the reptile into the air, with a series of
triumphant chuckles; after which it sat silent on a branch, contemplating the
dead snake with an air partly comical, partly profound, and waiting in grim
patience for a movement on the part of its victim which would furnish an excuse
for a renewal of hostilities.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil had time to note all this, for Old Corrie did not speak,
and the young man was debating how to commence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, Master Basil,&quot; said Old Corrie, presently, throwing
down his axe and taking out his pipe, a common short clay which he would not
have exchanged for thrice its weight in gold, &quot;what brings you this way? Any
message from Mr. Bidaud?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, Corrie,&quot; replied Basil sadly, &quot;you will receive no more
messages from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was thinking myself,&quot; said Corrie, glancing at Basil; and
not immediately recognising the gravity of the reply, &quot;that there mightn't be
any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What made you think that?&quot; asked Basil, in doubt whether the
man knew of Anthony Bidaud's death.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm down with the fever, Master Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am sorry to hear that, Corrie,&quot; said Basil in surprise, for
Old Corrie was the picture of health and strength. &quot;Can I do anything for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, Master Basil,&quot; said Old Corrie, with a smile and a kindly
look at Basil. &quot;The fever I'm down with ain't the kind of fever that's in your
mind. It's the gold fever I'm down with.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Basil, &quot;I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The wonder is that I've never been down with it before. If I
don't strike a rich claim or find a big nugget or two, I can always come back to
this.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you heard any news, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, two men camped out here last night, and we had a talk.
I gave 'em some tea, and their tongues got loosened a bit. There's a new
goldfield discovered somewhere in the north, and they're after it. A regular Tom
Tiddler's ground, Mr. Basil, only it's all gold and no silver. Twenty ounces to
the tub.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you're off?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When I've finished this job for Mr. Bidaud.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How long will that take you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About three weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it a contract job?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Signed on paper?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, we never had need of that. Mr. Bidaud's word is as good
as his bond; so's mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would not go on with it, Corrie, if I were you, till I made
sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because the gentleman who made the contract with you by word
of mouth is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Died this morning, suddenly, I grieve to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie took his pipe from his mouth, and sent a look of
reproach in the direction of the laughing jackass, from whose throat proceeded a
faint gurgle of laughter. At this look the quaint bird--as odd a specimen of the
feathered tribes as Old Corrie was of the human race--checked--its mirth, and
cocking its head knowingly on one side, inquired with its speaking eye what was
the matter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's bad news, Master Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The worst of news, Corrie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Died suddenly?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite suddenly. It is a great shock.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What's to become of the little lady?&quot; asked Old Corrie, in a
sympathising tone. The inquiry was addressed as much to himself as to Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is one of the things that are troubling me, Corrie. You
are a favourite of hers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've seen her grow up, and remember her mother well. I've
cause. Once when I was down with the colonial fever--almost as bad as the gold
fever, Master Basil--Mrs. Bidaud as good as nursed me through it, coming or
sending every day for two months and more, till I got strong. When I was well I
went up to the house to thank her. The little lady was just toddling about, and
made friends with me. I shall never forget Mrs. Bidaud; I went to her funeral.
You stopped at my hut before you came here, I expect.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes; I thought you might be there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you hear anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only the sound of your axe in the woods.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I mean inside the hut. There's a magpie there that's got the
sense of a human being and a voice like a flute. I only got it a fortnight ago,
and I've tamed it already, surprising. Back as white as snow, Master Basil, and
breast and wings shining like black satin. A handsome bird, and quite young. It
says 'Little lady; Little lady!' and 'Miss Annette!' in a way that'll astonish
you. I'm doing it for the little lady herself, and I'm glad I began it because
I'm going away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will please her greatly, Corrie, if she is allowed to
accept it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What's to prevent her? Poor little lady! First her mother,
then her father. I thought there was trouble in your face when I saw it. Would
you mind explaining, Master Basil, about this wood-splitting contract of mine?
Why shouldn't I finish it till I made sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then Basil told of the arrival of the dead man's brother and
sister, and was not delicate in expressing his opinion of Gilbert Bidaud.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're not the sort of man,&quot; said Old Corrie thoughtfully,
&quot;to speak, ill behind another's back without good reason. Little lady's uncle
must be a bad lot. A man and a woman, you say, foreign looking. They must be the
pair that passed my hut early this morning when I was getting up. They didn't
stop; she wanted to, I think, but he wouldn't let her. 'Curse you!' I heard him
say, 'What are you lagging for? Put life into your miserable limbs; we haven't
got far to go.' It seemed to me as if he laid hands on her to drag her along. I
came out of the hut, and saw them ahead, the woman walking as if she was dead
beat, and the man lugging her on. They never turned to look behind, and I
watched till they were out of sight. I'm sorry for the little lady. I'll go up
to the house to-day, and judge for myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You may hear something against me, Corrie. Don't believe it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I won't, without reason. I make up my mind slow, Master
Basil. Perhaps you've got something more to tell me. It won't be thrown away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Wishing to stand well with Old Corrie, Basil became more
communicative, and put the woodman in possession, of the particulars of what had
passed between himself and Anthony Bidaud on the previous evening, and also of
his interviews with Anthony's brother.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It looks black,&quot; said Old Corrie. &quot;It's a pity you didn't
leave him to the alligator. And now, Master Basil, you've something else in your
mind. Out with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I came to ask you to do me a great service.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give it mouth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It may be that poor Annette's father has left some papers
with respect to her future which the law might declare valid. If that is so, and
her uncle finds them, he will destroy them; it may be to his interest to do so,
and in that case he will allow no considerations of right and wrong to stand in
his way. The presence of a lawyer may prevent this. Then there is the slanderous
talk he is sure to set going against me; I want to clear myself of it. The
precise cause of Anthony Bidaud's death should be ascertained and declared by a
competent and disinterested person, and I thought of going to Gum Flat and
enlisting the services of a lawyer and a doctor, whom I would bring back with
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would be a proper thing to do,&quot; said Corrie.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But I am in a difficulty. I could walk the distance, but I
could not get there till to-morrow. Coming and going, four days at least would
be wasted, and in that time Annette's uncle could work his own ends without
interruption. Now, if I had a horse I could get there this evening, and back
to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You want me to lend you my mare?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is what I came to ask you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can have her; she's a willing creature, and 'll go till
she drops.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is kind of you, Corrie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all. I do it a little bit for your sake, but a good
deal more for the sake of the little lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You run a risk, Corrie. My story may not be true; I may never
come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll take security, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have no money. The only thing I possess of value is this
watch and chain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I won't take that; you may need it to pay the lawyer and the
doctor with. Besides that isn't the security I mean. I'll take your word.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're a real good fellow, Corrie. Some day I may be able to
repay you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I had any idea of looking out for that day I shouldn't do
what I'm doing. Look here, Master Basil. I know a gentleman when I see one; and
you're a gentleman. I believe every word you've told me. This fellow that's
turned up, the little lady's uncle, is a scoundrel, or he wouldn't have spoken
the words I heard to a woman nearly dead with fatigue--his own sister, too. Come
along; let's saddle the mare.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Before that was done, however, Old Corrie insisted that Basil
should eat a hearty meal and see the magpie he was training for Annette. Then
Basil mounted the willing mare, and with a grip of the hand and a hearty &quot;Good
luck, mate,&quot; from Old Corrie, the young man started for Gum Flat.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_09" href="#div1Ref_09">CHAPTER IX.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">It was three months since Basil had passed through the
conglomeration of canvas tents and stores which rejoiced in a title which
certainly could not be called euphonious, and then, although those were its most
prosperous days, it struck him as being a wretched hole. Rumours of rich finds
of gold had originally attracted a population to Gum Flat township, but the
glowing anticipations of the gold diggers who flocked to the false El Dorado
were doomed to disappointment. It was not a gold-diggers' but a storekeepers'
rush, and the result was a foregone conclusion; after a time the miners who had
flocked thither began to desert the place. Not, however, before they gave it a
fair trial. They marked out claims, they prospected the hills and gullies, they
turned the waters of a large creek, they sank shafts in many a likely-looking
spot, they followed spurs of stones on the ranges in the hope that they would
lead them to a rich quartz reef, but their labours were unrewarded. A couple of
specks to the dish and the faintest traces of gold in the quartz were not
sufficient to pay for powder and tobacco, and the men gradually began to leave
the uninviting locality. A few remained, but not to dig for gold; these were
chiefly loafers, and lived on each other, playing billiards during the day on
the one billiard table that had been left behind, and cards during the nights,
for fabulous and visionary sums of money which, really lost and won, would have
transformed beggars into millionaires and millionaires into beggars. The poorer
they grew the larger the stakes they played for, and their delusions created for
their delectation the most delicious paroxysms of infinite joy and overwhelming
despair. These they enjoyed to the full, reckoning up their losses and gains
with wild eyes and radiant countenances. One beggarly loafer, who for the last
five years had not had five pounds to bless himself with, went to the creek one
dark night after a visionary loss of a hundred thousand pounds or so, and
insisted upon drowning himself. It required a vast amount of insistence on his
part, for the creek just then was not more than three feet deep. Anyway, he was
found dead the next morning, with a letter in his pocket to the effect that he
was financially ruined and could not survive the disgrace; whereupon his
principal creditor, who, in the matter of finances, was no better off than the
drowned man, perambulated High Street in a state of fury, fiercely denouncing
his debtor who had not the courage to live and pay his debts of honour.</p>

<p class="normal">Some means of subsistence, however inadequate, Gum Flat must
have had; these were found in the persons of a half-a-dozen drivers of bullock
drays, who every two weeks brought their earnings there and spent them royally.
This process lasted on each occasion exactly three days, during which time the
population, numbering in all not more than thirty souls, were in clover. When
the bullock drivers returned to their avocations the loafers declared that the
colonies were going to the dogs, and resumed the routine of their dismal days,
gambling, drinking, quarrelling, until the six solvent men returned again to
gladden their hearts.</p>

<p class="normal">Even this miserable state of affairs came to an end after a
time, and reached a more deplorable stage. The bullock drivers discovered more
agreeable quarters, and in their turn deserted the township. Driven by sheer
necessity the loafers, one by one, followed their example, and slunk from the
place, until only four remained. Such was the condition of Gum Flat as Basil
rode towards the township on a day eventful enough in the story of his life, but
scarcely less eventful than the night which followed it was destined to be. Had
he been aware of this he would have thought twice before he made up his mind to
proceed thither in search of lawyer and doctor; but such is the irony of
circumstances that, had he not set forth on his present journey, the entire
course of his future life would have drifted into channels which would, almost
to a certainty, have separated him from Annette for ever. Accident or fate,
which you will; but the course of many lives is thus determined.</p>

<p class="normal">He rode all day through the tracks he remembered, and
concerning which he had been refreshed by Old Corrie, who was as ignorant as
himself of the deplorable change that had taken place. The road for a few miles
lay along great plains of rich black soil, dotted here and there with masses of
blue and barley grass, among which might be found the native leek and wild
cucumber; then followed a tract of country somewhat lightly timbered but heavily
grassed, where he came across a nasty bit of &quot;devil devil&quot; land, fortunately of
not great extent, for he had to ride with a loose rein and leave it to his horse
to pick the safest way. On his left were large lagoons in which a wondrous
variety of wild fowl abounded; on his right was a belt of impenetrable scrub;
but the track was well defined, and after riding twenty miles he entered a
thickly wooded forest, for the shade of which he was grateful, the sun now being
high in the heavens. Emerging from this forest he halted near a vast sheet of
water, in which tall reeds grew, and where he found the wild banana. Off this
fruit and some cold meat and bread which Old Corrie had forced upon him, he made
a sufficient meal, and then resumed his journey. In the afternoon the road lay
through a more even country, and he reckoned upon reaching Gum Flat before
sundown. But he reckoned without his host, for the distance was longer than he
calculated, and at sunset he was still, according to the information given to
him by the driver of a bullock dray, eight or ten miles from the township. This
man was the only human being he had met in his lonely ride. Many a time in the
course of the day had he fallen into contemplation of the pregnant events of the
last twenty-four hours, thinking, &quot;This time yesterday I was walking with
Annette in the woods, gathering wildflowers for her mother's grave. She slipped,
and I caught her in my arms.&quot; And again: &quot;This time yesterday Anthony Bidaud,
Annette, and I, were sitting in the verandah, watching the sunset; and a moment
afterwards white stars were glittering in the clouds of faded gold. How
peaceful, how happy we were! And now?&quot; he shuddered as he thought of the dead
form of Anthony Bidaud lying in his room and of the sense of desolation which
must have fallen upon Annette. He strove to direct his thoughts into more
cheerful grooves, but he was not successful.</p>

<p class="normal">The gorgeous colours in the heavens melted away; the sun
dipped beneath the horizon; it was night. Fortunately it was light, and he could
see the road he was riding over. The willing animal he bestrode plodded on, more
slowly now, and Basil did not attempt to quicken the pace. It was ten o'clock
when he reached the township of Gum Flat.</p>

<p class="normal">He recognised it by the outlines of the tents. He had expected
to see lights in the dwellings, arguing that Gum Flat must have increased in
importance since his last visit, but all was dark on the outskirts. He was
surprised at the darkness, but grateful that his journey was over. He rode along
the High Street, and with still deeper surprise observed that on some of the
stores the canvas lay loose, and that the calico over the frame was torn and
rent. &quot;Can I have mistaken the road?&quot; he thought. In the middle of the High
Street he paused. The door of a store was thrown suddenly open, and three men,
whose movements had been inspired by the sound of the horse's hoofs, emerged
therefrom, and stood looking up at Basil. Each had cards in his hand, denoting
that when they were disturbed they had been gambling. The picture at that moment
was Rembrandtesque. The street was in darkness; not a light was visible. One of
the men standing at the door held above his head a lighted candle stuck in a
whiskey bottle, and this dim light enabled the three-gamblers and Basil not
exactly to see each other but to define outlines. Through the open door Basil
saw a table upon which was another candle, and sitting at which was another man,
also with cards in his hand. This man, leaning forward, was striving to pierce
the gloom in which his companions and Basil stood. He rose and joined them, and
going close to Basil, laid his hand upon the horse's neck. Thus, Basil and he
confronted each other. And at that moment was commenced the weaving of a strand
which was to connect the lives of these two men, for weal or woe.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_10" href="#div1Ref_10">CHAPTER X.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Each man of this small group represented in his own person the
epitome of a drama more or less stirring and eventful. With three of these we
have little to do, and no good purpose will be served by recounting their
antecedents. The history of the fourth--he who stood with his hand on the neck
of Old Corrie's horse, looking up at Basil--will presently be unfolded.</p>

<p class="normal">He was a full-bearded man, the light brown hair so effectually
concealing his features that only his cheekbones and forehead were visible. To a
physiologist, therefore, the index was imperfect. He was a young man, of about
the same age as Basil, and his name was Newman Chaytor. This was his true name;
it will be as well to say as much, for there was much that was false about him.</p>

<p class="normal">The man who held the candle was known as Jim the Hatter; Jim
belonged properly to him by right, the Hatter was patronymic he had earned by
working on various goldfields alone, without a mate. Why they call men on the
gold-diggings thus inclined, Hatters, is one of the mysteries, but it is a fact.
Of the other two it will be sufficient to refer to them as Nonentity Number One
and Nonentity Number Two. Jim the Hatter was a large-boned, loose-limbed man, of
great strength. Upon his first arrival in Australia his time, to put it gently,
was not his own; it belonged to his country. He was now free, but his morals had
not been improved by the lesson his country had administered to him.</p>

<p class="normal">It will thus be seen that Basil had unfortunately fallen among
thieves.</p>

<p class="normal">For a few moments the man on horseback and the men on foot
preserved silence, and opportunity was afforded for a striking picture. Jim the
Hatter was the first to speak.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, mate?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is this the township of Gum Flat?&quot; inquired Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is. If you're looking for it, you're dead on the gutter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought I must have mistaken my way,&quot; said Basil. &quot;What has
come over the place?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Newman Chaytor answered him. &quot;It has gone,&quot; he said, &quot;to the
dogs.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Like yourselves,&quot; thought Basil, gazing at the men, but
deeming it prudent not to express himself aloud upon a point so personal. He
spoke, however. &quot;It is the place I was making for. I suppose I can put up here
for the night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's nothing to prevent you. Gum Flat township just now is
Liberty Hall.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Stop a bit, stop a bit,&quot; said Nonentity Number One,
considering it necessary to his dignity that he should take part in the
conference. &quot;Is the gentleman prepared to pay for accommodation?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's a proper question,&quot; said Nonentity Number Two, thus
asserting himself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course he is,&quot; said Jim the Hatter, answering for Basil,
who, with an empty purse, was saved from awkwardness.</p>

<p class="normal">A diversion occurred here. Newman Chaytor snatched the candle
from Jim the Hatter, in order that he might obtain a clearer view of Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Manners, mate,&quot; said Jim the Hatter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Manners be hanged!&quot; retorted Newman Chaytor, holding the
candle high. &quot;They're out of stock.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This was evident. To smooth matters Basil volunteered an
explanation. &quot;I have come hereupon business, but I am afraid I have lost my
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; said Jim the Hatter. &quot;We're all business men
here; ready at a moment's notice to turn a honest penny. That's true, ain't it,
mate?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He addressed Newman Chaytor, but that worthy did not reply.
Having obtained a clearer view of Basil's face, he seemed to be suddenly struck
dumb, and stared at it as though he were fascinated.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still,&quot; continued Jim the Hatter, &quot;it's as well to be
particular in these times. I'm very choice in the company I keep, and I don't as
a rule do business with strangers, unless,&quot; he added, with a grin which found
its reflection on the lips of Nonentities Numbers One and Two, &quot;they pay their
footing first.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you wish to know my name,&quot; said Basil, &quot;it is Basil
Whittingham.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What!&quot; cried Newman Chaytor, finding his tongue; but the
exclamation of undoubted astonishment appeared to be forced from him instead of
being voluntarily uttered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil Whittingham,&quot; repeated Basil. &quot;Being here, I must stop
for the night. Is there a stable near?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's one at the back,&quot; said Newman Chaytor, with sudden
alacrity, &quot;or rather there was one. I'll show you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Basil, and followed his guide to the rear of
the shanty.</p>

<p class="normal">The three men looked after them with no good will.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He's a swell,&quot; said Nonentity Number One.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He's got a watch and chain,&quot; said Nonentity Number Two.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And a horse,&quot; said Jim the Hatter.</p>

<p class="normal">Then they re-entered the store, and settled down to their game
of cards.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Stop here a moment,&quot; said Newman Chaytor to Basil. &quot;I'll get
a light.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Returning with a candle stuck in a bottle, the fashionable
form of candlestick in Gum Flat, he waved it about, sometimes so close to Basil
that it shone upon his features.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You stare at me,&quot; said Basil, &quot;as if you knew me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never saw you before to my knowledge.&quot; (A falsehood, but that
is a detail.) &quot;You're not a colonial.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am an Englishman, like yourself, I judge.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I am English.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have the advantage of me--you know my name. May I ask
yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Chaytor, but he spoke, nevertheless, with a
certain hesitation, as if something of importance hung upon it. &quot;My name is
Newman, with Chaytor tacked to it.&quot; Then, anxiously, &quot;Have you heard it before?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never. This is a tumble-down place. It is a courtesy to call
it a stable.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will serve, in place of a better.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes, it is better than nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Everything is tumble-down in Gum Flat. I am an Englishman
town-bred. And you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My people hail from Devonshire.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am not dreaming, then,&quot; said Chaytor, speaking for the
second time involuntarily.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dreaming!&quot; exclaimed Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was thinking of another matter,&quot; said Chaytor, with
readiness. &quot;Speaking my thoughts aloud is one of my bad tricks.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One of mine, too,&quot; said Basil smiling.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is not the only thing in which we're alike.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We are about the same age, about the same build, and we are
both gentlemen. Your horse is blown; you have ridden a long distance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;From Bidaud's plantation.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have heard of it. And you come upon business? I may be able
to assist you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall be glad of assistance,&quot; said Basil, recognising in
his companion an obvious superiority to the men they had left. &quot;When I passed
through Gum Flat a few months ago I thought it a township likely to thrive, and
now I find it pretty well deserted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It has gone to the dogs, as I told you. There's nothing but
grass for your horse to nibble at. So you're from Devonshire. Do your people
live there still?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He mixed up the subjects of his remarks in the oddest manner,
and cast furtive glances at Basil with a certain mental preoccupation which
would have forced itself upon Basil's attention had he not been so occupied with
his own special cares.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There are none left,&quot; said Basil. &quot;I am the only one
remaining.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The only one?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, I have an old uncle, but we are not exactly on amicable
terms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are better off than I am. I have no family left.&quot; He
sighed pathetically. &quot;I fancy I can lay my hands on a bundle of sweet hay.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should feel grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't leave the stable till I come back; I shan't be gone
long.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was absent ten minutes or so and though he went straight
about his errand, he was thinking of something very different. &quot;It is the most
wonderful thing in the world,&quot; ran his thoughts--&quot;that I should meet him here
again, in this hole, not changed in the slightest! It can't be accident; it was
predestined, and I should be a self-confessed idiot if I did not take advantage
of it. But how is it to be worked? His uncle is still alive. What did he say?
'We are not exactly on amicable terms.' That is because he is proud. I am not. I
should be a better nephew to the old fellow than this upstart. He is very old,
in his second childhood most likely. This is the turning-point of my life, and I
will not throw away the chance. Just as I was at the bottom of the ladder, too.
I'll climb to the top--I will, I will!&quot; He raised his hand to the skies, as
though registering an oath.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There,&quot; he said, throwing down a bundle of hay which the
horse immediately began to munch, &quot;with a bucket of water your mare will do very
well. I'll fetch it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are very kind,&quot; said Basil, warming to Newman Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>.&quot; This was said with a
grand air.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil held out his hand, and Chaytor pressed it effusively.
Then, at Chaytor's request, Basil spoke of the errand upon which he was engaged,
and being plied skilfully with questions, put his companion in possession of a
great deal he wished to know, not only in relation to the affairs of Bidaud's
plantation, but his own personal history as well.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is curious,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;that we two should have met at
such a time and in such a place. Who knows what may come of it? I am, strange to
say, a bit of a doctor and a bit of a lawyer, and if you will accept my services
I shall be glad to accompany you back to Bidaud's plantation.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But why?&quot; asked Basil, touched by the apparently unselfish
offer. &quot;I have no claim upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Except the claim that one gentleman has upon another--which
should count for something. It always has with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Upon my word I don't know how to thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't try. It is myself I am rendering a service to, not you.
This deserted hole, and the association of those men&quot;--jerking his thumb over
his shoulder in the direction of the tent--&quot;sicken me. Does there not come to
some men a crisis in their lives which compels them to turn over a new leaf, as
the saying is, to cut themselves away entirely from the past and commence life
anew?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Basil, struck by the application of this figure of
speech to his own circumstances, &quot;it has come to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And to me. I intended to leave Gum Flat to-morrow, and I did
not know in which direction. I felt like Robinson Crusoe on the desert island,
without a friend, without a kindred soul to talk to, to associate with. If you
will allow me to look upon you as a friend you will put me under a deep
obligation. Should the brother of the poor gentleman who died so suddenly this
morning--the father of that sweet young lady of whom you speak so
tenderly--succeed in having things all his own way, you will be cast adrift, as
I am. It is best to look things straight in the face, is it not?--even
unpleasant things.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the most sensible course,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Exactly. The most sensible course--and the most manly. Why
should not you and I throw in our fortunes together? I am sure we should suit
each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can but thank you,&quot; said Basil. &quot;It is worth thinking
over.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right; there is plenty of time before us. Let us go into
the store now. A word of warning first. The men inside are not to be trusted. I
was thrown into their company against my will, and I felt that the association
was degrading to me. We can't pick and choose in this part of the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed we cannot. I will not forget your warning. To speak
honestly, I am not in the mood or condition for society. I have had a hard day,
and am dead beat.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You would like to turn in,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;I can give you a
shakedown, and for supper what remains of a tin of biscuits and a tin of
sardines. There, don't say a word. The luck's on my side. Come along.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The Nonentities and Jim the Hatter were in the midst of a
wrangle when they entered, and scarcely noticed them. This left Chaytor free to
attend to Basil. He placed before him the biscuits and sardines, and produced a
flask of brandy. Basil was grateful for the refreshment; he was thoroughly
exhausted, and it renewed his strength and revived his drooping spirits. Then he
filled his pipe, and conversed in low tones with his new friend, while the
gamblers continued their game.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I stop up much longer,&quot; said Basil, when he had had his
smoke, &quot;I shall drop off my seat.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor rose and preceded him to the further end of the store.
The building, if such a designation may be allowed to an erection composed of
only wood and canvas, had been the most pretentious and imposing in the palmy
days of the township, and although now it was all tattered and torn, like the
man in the nursery rhyme, it could still boast of half a dozen private
compartments in which sleepers could find repose and solitude. The walls of
course were of calico, and for complete privacy darkness was necessary.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor and the three gamblers who were bending over their
cards in the dim light of the larger space without, each occupied one of these
sleeping compartments. Two remained vacant, and into one of these Chaytor led
Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">There was a stretcher in the room, a piece of strong canvas
nailed upon four pieces of batten driven into the ground. The canvas was bare;
there were no bedclothes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have two blankets,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;I can spare you one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil was too tired to protest. Dressed as he was he threw
himself upon the stretcher, drew the blanket over him, and bidding his
hospitable friend good-night, and thanking him again, was fast asleep almost as
the words passed his lips.</p>

<p class="normal">Newman Chaytor stood for a moment or two gazing upon the
sleeping man. &quot;I can't be dreaming,&quot; he thought; &quot;he is here before me, and I am
wide awake. I drink to the future.&quot; He held no glass, but he went through the
pantomime of drinking out of one.</p>

<p class="normal">Taking the lighted candle with him he joined his mates, and
left Basil sleeping calmly in darkness. They were no longer playing cards, but
with heads close together were debating in whispers. Upon Chaytor's entrance
they shifted their positions and ceased talking.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you put your gentleman to bed?&quot; asked Jim the Hatter, in
a sneering tone in which a sinister ring might have been detected.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Much obliged to you for the inquiry,&quot; replied Chaytor,
prepared to fence; &quot;he is sound asleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Interesting child! A case of love at first sight, mates.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Nonentities Numbers One and Two nodded, with dark looks at
Chaytor, who smiled genially at them and commenced to smoke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Or,&quot; said Jim the Hatter, &quot;perhaps an old acquaintance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take your choice,&quot; observed Chaytor, who, in finesse and
coolness, was a match for the three.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Doesn't it strike you, Newman, that it's taking a liberty
with us to feed and bolster him up, and stand drinks as well, without asking
whether we was agreeable?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all. The sardines were mine, the biscuits were mine,
the grog was mine. If you want to quarrel, say so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm for peace and quietness,&quot; said Jim the Hatter,
threateningly. &quot;I was only expressing my opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I mine. Look here, mates, I don't want to behave
shabbily, so I'll tell you what is in my mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, do,&quot; said Jim the Hatter, with a secret sign to the
Nonentities which Chaytor did not see; &quot;then we shall know where we are.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll tell you where we are, literally, mates. We're in a
heaven-forsaken township, running fast to bone, which leads to skeleton. Now I'm
not prepared for that positive eventuality just yet. This world is good enough
for me at present, and I mean to do my best to enjoy it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can't you enjoy it in our company?&quot; asked Jim the Hatter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think not,&quot; said Chaytor, with cool insolence. &quot;The best of
friends must part.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, that's your little game, is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is my little game. I am growing grey. If I don't look
out I shall be white before I am thirty. Really I think it must be the effect of
the company I have kept.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We're not good enough for you, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you ask for my deliberate opinion I answer, most
distinctly not. No, mates, not by a long way good enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't be stuck up, mate. Better men than you have had to eat
humble pie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Any sort of pie,&quot; said Chaytor, philosophically, &quot;is better
than no pie at all. Take my advice. Bid good-bye to Gum Flat, gigantic fraud
that it is, and go in search of big nuggets. That is what I am going to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With your gentleman friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With my gentleman friend. We may as well part civilly, but if
you choose the other thing I am agreeable.&quot; The three men rose with the
intention of retiring. They did not respond to his invitation to part friends.
&quot;Well, good-night, and good luck to you.&quot; They nodded surlily and entered their
sleeping apartments, after exchanging a few words quietly between themselves.</p>

<p class="normal">Newman Chaytor helped himself to brandy from his flask then
filled his pipe, and began to smoke.</p>

<p class="normal">That he had something serious to think of was evident, and
that he was puzzled what use to make of it was quite as clear. An enterprise was
before him, and he was disposed to pledge himself to it; but he was in the dark
as to what end it would lead him. In the dark, also, how it could be so
conducted as to result in profit to himself. He was in desperately low water,
and had lost confidence in himself. His ship was drifting anchorless on a waste
of waters; suddenly an anchor had presented itself, which, while it would afford
him peace and safety for a time, might show him a way to a golden harbour. An
ugly smile wreathed his lips, the sinister aspect of which was hidden by his
abundant hair: but it was there, and remained for many musing moments. He took
from his pocket a common memorandum book, and on a few blank pages he wrote the
names, Newman Chaytor and Basil Whittingham, several times and in several
different styles of handwriting. Then he wrote upon one, in the form of a check,
&quot;Pay to Newman Chaytor, Esq., the sum of forty thousand pounds. Basil
Whittingham.&quot; He contemplated this valueless draft for a long time before
destroying it at the candle's light, as he destroyed the other sheets of paper
upon which he had written the signatures.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All the pleasures of existence,&quot; he mused, &quot;all the light,
everything in the world worth having, are on the other side of the water. Was I
born to grind out my days in a prison like this? No, and I will not. Here is the
chance of escape&quot;--he turned his head to the room in which Basil was
sleeping--&quot;with possibilities which may give me all I desire. It would be flying
in the face of Providence to neglect it. The first law of nature is Self. I
should be a born fool not to obey the first law of nature.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In these reflections he passed an hour, when he determined to
go to bed.</p>

<p class="normal">All was still. He stepped on tip toe to each of the four
compartments occupied by Basil, Jim the Hatter, and the Nonentities, and
listened at the doors to assure himself that he was the only wakeful person in
the store. Deeming himself safe he entered his own room, and taking a small
round mirror in a zinc frame from the top of a packing case which served as
washstand and dressing-table, gazed at his face with strange intentness. Putting
the hand mirror down he cast wary looks around. Yes, he was alone; there were no
witnesses. Then he did a curious thing. He took off his beard and whiskers.</p>

<p class="normal">In the room on his right lay Basil asleep; in the room on his
left was Jim the Hatter, whom he supposed to be. But in this he reckoned without
his host, as many another sharp rogue has done in his time. Jim the Hatter,
despite his deep breathing, which had deceived Newman Chaytor, was wide awake.
The moment Chaytor entered his room Jim the Hatter had slipped noiselessly from
his stretcher, and his face was now glued to the wall of calico through which
the light of Chaytor's candle was shining. There was a small slit in the calico,
which enabled Jim the Hatter to see what was passing in Chaytor's room.
Chaytor's back, however, was towards the wall through which he was peeping. The
watcher was puzzled; he could not exactly discover what it was Chaytor had done.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon Chaytor's face, now beardless and whiskerless, there was
a natural growth of hair in the shape of a moustache. This moustache was the
precise colour of that which Basil grew and cherished. It was not so long, but a
few week's growth would make the resemblance perfect, if such was Chaytor's
wish. In other respects the resemblance between him and Basil was remarkable.
Height, figure, complexion--even the colour of the eyes--all tallied.</p>

<p class="normal">In his anxiety to discover exactly what was going on, Jim the
Hatter made a slight movement, which was heard by Chaytor. He turned suddenly,
and the astonished watcher beheld the counterpart of Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By Jove!&quot; he said inly; &quot;twins!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, warned by Chaytor's attitude that he was in danger of
himself being discovered, he slipped between his blankets as noiselessly as he
had slipped out of them. Waiting only to resume his disguise of beard and
whiskers, Chaytor, candle in hand, went quietly and swiftly into the adjoining
room and looked down upon the recumbent form of Jim the Hatter. Undoubtedly
asleep, and sleeping like a top. Chaytor passed the candle across the man's
face, who never so much as winked. Assured that there was no cause for alarm,
Chaytor stepped back to his own recess, put out the light, and went to bed.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_11" href="#div1Ref_11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Leaving this schemer to his ill-earned repose, we strip the
veil from his past and lay it bare.</p>

<p class="normal">Nature plays tricks, but seldom played a stranger than that of
casting Newman Chaytor physically in the same mould as Basil. Born in different
counties, with no tie of kinship between their families, their likeness to each
other was so marvellous that any man seeing them for the first time side by
side, without some such disguise as Chaytor wore on Gum Flat, and the second
time apart, would have been puzzled to know which was which. But not less
strange than this physical likeness was the contrast between their moral
natures. One was the soul of guilelessness and honour, the other the soul of
cunning and baseness. One walked the straight paths of life, the other chose the
crooked.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor was born in London, and his parents occupied a
respectable position. They gave him a good education, and did all they could to
furnish him worthily for the battle of life. The affection they displayed was
ill-requited. In his mother's eyes he was perfection, but his father's mind was
often disturbed when he thought of the lad's future. Perhaps in his own nature
there was a moral twist which caused him to doubt; perhaps his own youth was
distinguished by the vices he detected in his son. However that may be, he took
no blame to himself, preferring rather to skim the surface than to seek
discomfort in psychological depths.</p>

<p class="normal">The parents discussed their son's future.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We will make a doctor of him,&quot; said the father.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will be a great physician,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p class="normal">At this time Chaytor was eighteen years of age. At twenty it
was decided that he was in the wrong groove; at least, that was the statement of
the doctor who had undertaken his professional education. It was not an entirely
ingenuous statement; the master was eager to get rid of his pupil, whose sharp
practices distressed him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What would you like to be?&quot; asked his father.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A lawyer,&quot; replied Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will be Lord Chancellor,&quot; said his mother.</p>

<p class="normal">Thereupon Newman Chaytor was articled to a firm of lawyers in
Bedford Row, London, W.C., an old and respectable firm, Messrs. Rivington, Sons,
and Rivington, who kept its exceedingly lucrative business in the hands of its
own family. It happened, fatefully, that this firm of lawyers transacted the
affairs of Bartholomew Whittingham, Basil's uncle, with whom our readers have
already made acquaintance.</p>

<p class="normal">In the course of two or three years Chaytor's character was
fully developed. He was still the idol of his mother, whose heart was plated
with so thick a shield of unreasoning love that nothing to her son's
disparagement could make an impression upon it. Only there were doors in this
shield which she opened at the least sign from the reprobate, sheltering him
there and cooing over him as none but such hearts can. Her husband had the
sincerest affection for her, and here was another safeguard for Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">The surroundings of life in a great and gay city are dangerous
and tempting even to the innocent. How much more dangerous and tempting are they
to those who by teaching or inclination are ripe for vice? It is not our
intention to follow Chaytor through these devious paths; we shall simply touch
lightly upon those circumstances of his career which are pertinent to our story.
If for a brief space we are compelled to treat of some of the darker shadows of
human nature, it must be set down to the undoubted fact that life is not made up
entirely of sweetness and light.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor's father, looking through his bank-book, discovered
that he had a balance to his credit less by a hundred pounds than he knew was
correct. He examined his returned cheques and found one with his signature for
the exact amount, a signature written by another hand than his. He informed his
wife, pending his decision as to what steps to take to bring the guilt home. His
wife informed her son.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah,&quot; said he, &quot;I have my suspicions.&quot; And he mentioned the
name of a clerk in his father's employ.</p>

<p class="normal">The ball being set rolling, the elder Chaytor began to watch
the suspected man, setting traps for him, across which the innocent man stepped
in safety. Mr. Chaytor was puzzled; he had, by his wife's advice, kept the
affair entirely secret, who in her turn had been prompted by her son to this
course, and warned not to drag his name into it. The father, therefore was not
aware that the accusation against the clerk proceeded from his son.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor had a design in view: he wished to gain time to avoid
possible unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p class="normal">Some three weeks afterwards, when Mr. Chaytor had resolved to
take the forged cheque to the bank with the intention of enlisting its services
in the discovery of the criminal, he went to his desk to obtain the document. It
was gone, and other papers with it. He was confounded; without the cheque he
could do nothing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have I a thief in my house,&quot; he asked of himself, &quot;as well as
a forger at my elbow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The man he had suspected was in the habit of coming to his
private house once a week for clerking purposes. Without considering what he was
laying himself open to, he accused his clerk of robbing him, and the result was
that the man left his service and brought an action for slander against him,
which he was compelled to compromise by an apology and the payment of a sum of
money.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is father's own fault,&quot; said Chaytor to his mother; &quot;had
he waited and watched, he would have brought the guilt home to the fellow. But
don't say anything more to him about it; let the matter rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It did rest, but Mr. Chaytor did not forget it.</p>

<p class="normal">Being in pursuit of pleasure Chaytor found himself in
continual need of money, and he raised and procured it in many discreditable
ways, but still he managed to keep his secret. Then came another crime. Some
valuable jewels belonging to his mother were stolen. By whom?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By one of the female servants, of course,&quot; said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">He was not only without conscience, he was without heart.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Chaytor proposed to call in a detective. Mrs. Chaytor,
acting upon the secret advice of her son, would not hear of it. The father had,
therefore, two forces working against him, his wife, whom he could answer,
because she was in the light, and his son, with whom he could not cope, because
he was in the dark.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would be a dreadful scandal,&quot; said young Chaytor to his
mother. &quot;If nothing is discovered--and thieves are very cunning, you know--we
shall be in worse trouble than father got into with the clerk who forged his
name to the cheque. We should be the laughing-stock of everyone who knows us,
and should hardly be able to raise our heads.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His word was law to her; he could twist her round his little
finger, he often laughingly said to himself; and as she, in her turn, dominated
her husband, the deceits he practised were not too difficult for him to safely
compass. Every domestic in the house was discharged, and a new set engaged. When
they sent for characters no answer was returned. Thus early in life young
Chaytor was fruitful in mischief, but he cared not what occurred to others so
long as he rode in safety.</p>

<p class="normal">One day an old gentleman paid a visit to Messrs. Rivington,
Sons, and Rivington. This was Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham, Basil's uncle. He had
come upon the business of his will, the particulars of which he had written down
upon paper. He was not in the office longer than ten minutes, and he left at
half-past one o'clock, the time at which Chaytor was in the habit of going to
lunch. Following the old gentleman Chaytor saw him step into a cab, in which a
young gentleman had been waiting. The young gentleman was Basil, and Chaytor was
startled at the resemblance of this man to himself. Relinquishing his lunch,
Chaytor jumped into a cab, and bade the driver follow Basil and his uncle. They
stopped at Morley's Hotel, Charing Cross, and Chaytor had another opportunity of
verifying the likeness between himself and Basil. It interested him and excited
him. He had not the least idea what he could gain by it, but the fact took
possession of his mind and he could not dislodge it. He ascertained the names of
Basil and his uncle by looking over the hotel book, and when he returned to the
office in Bedford Row the task was allotted to him of preparing the rough draft
of the will. Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham was very rich, and every shilling he
possessed was devised to Basil, without restrictions of any kind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The old fellow must be worth forty thousand pounds,&quot; mused
Chaytor, and he rolled out the sum again and again. &quot;For-ty thou-sand pounds!
For-ty thou-sand pounds! For-ty thousand pounds! And every shilling is left to
Mr. Basil Whittingham, my double. Yes, my Double! My own mother would mistake
him for me, and his doddering old uncle would mistake me for him. What wouldn't
I give to change places with him! For-ty thou-sand pounds! For-ty thou-sand
pounds! It's maddening to think of. He has a moustache; I haven't. But I can
grow one exactly like. His hair is the colour of mine. I'll keep my eye on him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was an egregiously wicked idea, for by the wildest stretch
of his imagination he could not see how this startling likeness could be worked
to his advantage. Nevertheless he was fascinated by it, and he set himself the
task of seeing as much of Basil as possible. During the week that Basil was
living at Morley's Hotel, Chaytor in his spare hours shadowed him, without being
detected. Basil never once set eyes on him, and as the young gentleman never
entered the office of Messrs. Rivington, Sons, and Rivington, no one there had
opportunity to note the resemblance between the men.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor for a week was in his element; he ascertained from the
hall porter in the hotel the places of amusement which Basil visited of an
evening, and he followed him to them; he waited outside the hotel to catch
glimpses of him; he studied every feature, every expression, every movement
attentively, until he declared to himself that he knew him by heart. He began to
let his moustache grow, and he practised little tricks of manners which he had
observed. He was like a man possessed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is a gentleman,&quot; he said. &quot;So am I. I am as good looking
as he is any day of the week. Why shouldn't I be, being his Double?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He pondered over it, he dreamt of it, he worked himself
almost into a fever concerning it. Distorted possibilities presented themselves,
and monstrous views. The phantom image of Basil entered into his life, directed
his thoughts, coloured his future. He walked along the streets with this
spectral Double by his side; he leant over the river's bridges and saw it
reflected in the water; he felt its presence when he woke up in the dark night.
One night during this feverish week, after being in the theatre which Basil
visited, after sitting in the shadow of the pit and watching him for hours in a
private box, after following him to Morley's Hotel and lingering so long in
Trafalgar Square that he drew the attention of a policeman to his movements, he
walked slowly homeward, twisting this and that possibility with an infatuation
dangerous to his reason, until he came quite suddenly upon a house on fire. So
engrossed was he that he had not noticed the hurrying people or their cries, and
it was only when the blazing flames were before him that he was conscious of
what was actually taking place. And there on the burning roof as he looked up he
beheld the phantom Basil on fire. With glaring eyes he saw it with the flames
devouring it, dwindling in proportions until its luminous outlines faded into
nothingness, until it was gone out of the living world for ever. A deep sigh of
satisfaction escaped him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now he is gone,&quot; he thought, &quot;I will take his place. His
uncle is an old man; I can easily deceive him; and perhaps even <i>he</i> will
die before morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In the midst of this ecstatic delirium a phantom hand was laid
upon his shoulder, a phantom face, with a mocking smile upon it, confronted him.
He struck at it with a muttered curse. It came to rob him of forty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p class="normal">Had this mental condition lasted long he must have gone mad.
The reason for this would have been that he had nothing to grapple with, nothing
to fight, nothing but a shadow, which he had magnified into a mortal enemy who
had done him a wrong which could only be atoned for by death. It was fortunate
for him, although he deserved no good fortune, that Basil's residence at
Morley's lasted but a week, and that he and his double did not meet again in the
Old World; for although Basil passed much of his time in his father's house in
London he lived at a long distance from Chaytor's usual haunts, and the young
men's lives did not cross. Gradually Chaytor's reason reasserted itself, and he
became sane. Grimly, desperately sane, with still the leading idea haunting him,
it is true, but no longer attended by monstrous conceptions of what might occur
in a day, in an hour, in a moment, and he on the spot ready to take advantage of
it.</p>

<p class="normal">Shortly after Basil's departure he asked his mother if she
ever had twins.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What on earth do you mean, my dear?&quot; she asked, laughing at
him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is plain enough,&quot; he answered incautiously. &quot;I dream
sometimes of a brother the exact counterpart of myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You work too hard,&quot; said his mother, pityingly. &quot;You must
take a holiday, my darling.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who's to pay for it?&quot; he asked gloomily.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am,&quot; she said fondly. &quot;I have saved fifty pounds for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give it to me,&quot; he said eagerly, and with the money he went
to Paris for a fortnight and squandered it on himself and his pleasures.</p>

<p class="normal">The foolish mother was continually doing this kind of thing,
saving up money, wheedling her husband out of it upon false pretexts, stinting
herself and making sacrifices for the worthless, ungrateful idol of her loving
heart. So time passed, and Chaytor was still in the office of Rivington, Sons,
and Rivington, picking up no sound knowledge of the law, but extracting from it
for future use all the sharp and cunning subtleties of which some vile men make
bad use. To the firm came a letter from Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham, with the
tenor of which Chaytor made himself familiar. He was a spy in the office, and
never scrupled at opening letters and reading them on the sly to master their
contents. In the letter which Basil's uncle wrote occurred these words:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Send me in a registered packet, by first post, my will, the
will I made in favour of my nephew, Mr. Basil Whittingham. He has acted like a
fool, and I am going to destroy it and disinherit him. At some future time I
will give you instructions to draw up another, making different dispositions of
my property. I am not a young man, but I shall live a good many years yet, and
there is plenty of time before me. Meanwhile bear witness by this letter that I
have disinherited my nephew Basil Whittingham.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Of course they followed his instructions, and the will was
forwarded to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has stolen forty thousand pounds from me,&quot; thought
Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">Within a week thereafter he overheard a conversation between
two of the principals. He was never above listening at doors and creeping up
back staircases. The lawyers were speaking of Bartholomew Whittingham and the
will.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will he destroy it?&quot; asked one.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think not,&quot; replied the other. &quot;It is my opinion he will
keep it by him, half intending to destroy it, half to preserve it, and that it
will be found intact and unaltered when he dies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not agree with you. He will destroy it one day in a
rage, and make another the next.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In favour of whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of his nephew. He has in his heart an absorbing love for the
young gentleman, and he is a good fellow at bottom. Mr. Basil Whittingham will
come into the whole of the property.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The conversation was continued on these lines, and the
partners ultimately agreed that after all Basil would be the heir. &quot;There is a
chance yet,&quot; thought Chaytor, for although the dangerous period of ecstasy was
passed there still lingered in his mind a hope of fortunate possibilities.</p>

<p class="normal">He continued his evil courses, gambled, drank, and led a free
life, getting deeper and deeper into debt. His mother assisted him out of many a
scrape, and never for one single moment wavered in her faith in him, in her love
for him. It was a sweet trait in her character, but love without wisdom is
frequently productive of more harm than good. Chaytor's position grew so
desperate that detection and its attendant disgraceful penalty became imminent.
He had made himself a proficient and skilful imitator of handwriting, and more
than once had he forged his father's name to cheques and bills. The father was
aware of this, but out of tenderness for his wife had done nothing more than
upbraid his son for the infamy. Many a stormy scene had passed between them,
which both carefully concealed from the knowledge of the fond woman whose heart
would have been broken had she known the truth. On every one of these occasions
Chaytor had humbled himself and promised atonement, with tears and sighs and
mock repentance which saddened but did not convince the father.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For your mother's sake,&quot; invariably he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; murmured the hypocrite, &quot;for my dear mother's
sake--my mother, so good, so loving, so tender-hearted!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let this be the last time,&quot; said the father sternly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be, it shall be!&quot; murmured the son.</p>

<p class="normal">It was a formula. The father may sometimes have deceived
himself into belief; the son, never. Even while he was humbling himself he would
be casting about for the next throw.</p>

<p class="normal">This continued for some considerable time, but at length came
the crash. Chaytor and his parents were seated at breakfast at nine o'clock. The
father had the morning letters in his pocket; he had read them and put them by.
He cast but one glance at his son, and Chaytor turned pale and winced. He saw
that the storm was about to burst. As usual, nothing was said before Mrs.
Chaytor. The meal was over, she kissed her son, and left the room to attend to
her domestic affairs.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must be off,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;Mustn't be late this morning.
A lot to attend to at the office.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You need not hurry,&quot; said the father. &quot;I have something to
say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Won't it keep till the evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No. It must be said here and now.&quot; He stepped to the door and
locked it. &quot;We will spare her as long as possible; she will know soon enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; said Chaytor sullenly. &quot;Fire away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The father took out his letters, and, selecting one, handed it
to his son who read it, shivered, and returned it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What have you to say to it?&quot; asked the father.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing. It is only for three hundred pounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A bill, due to-day, which I did not sign.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was done for all our sakes, to save the honour of the
family name. I was in a hole and there was no other way of getting out of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The bill must be taken up before twelve o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will it be?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will, for your mother's sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then there is nothing more to be said. I am very sorry, but
it could not be helped. I promise that it shall never occur again. I'll take my
oath of it if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I take neither your word nor your oath. You are a scoundrel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here, draw it mild. I am your son.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Unhappily. If your mother were not living you should be shown
into the dock for the forgery.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But she is alive. I shall not appear in the dock, and you may
as well let me go. Look here, father, what's the use of crying over spilt milk?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not much; and as I look upon you as hopeless, I would go on
paying for it while your mother lived. If she were taken from me I should leave
you to the punishment you deserve, and risk my name being dragged through the
mire.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope,&quot; said Chaytor, with vile sanctimoniousness, &quot;that my
dear mother will live till she is a hundred.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is, I must remind you, another side to the shield. I
said 'as long as I can afford it.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, you can afford it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot,&quot; said Mr. Chaytor, with a sour smile. &quot;My career
snaps to-day, after paying this forged bill with money that properly belongs to
my creditors. Newman Chaytor, you have come to the end of your tether.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are saying this to frighten me,&quot; said Chaytor, affecting
an indifference he did not feel. &quot;Why, you are rolling in money.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are mistaken. Speculations into which I have entered have
failed disastrously. If you had not robbed me to the tune of thousands of
pounds--the sum total of your villainies amounts to that--I might have weathered
the storm, but as I am situated it is impossible. It is almost a triumph to me
to stand here before you a ruined man, knowing you can no longer rob me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still I do not believe you,&quot; said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Wait and see; you will not have to wait long.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The tone in which he uttered this carried conviction with it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know what you have done?&quot; cried Chaytor furiously.
&quot;You have ruined <i>me!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What!&quot; responded Mr. Chaytor, with savage sarcasm. &quot;Is there
any more of this kind of paper floating about?&quot; Chaytor bit his lips, and his
fingers twitched nervously, but he did not reply. &quot;If there is be advised, and
prepare for it. In the list of my liabilities, which is now being prepared,
there will be no place for them. How should there be, when I am in ignorance of
your prospective villainies. Do you see now to what you have brought me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do <i>you</i> see to what you have brought <i>me?</i>&quot;
exclaimed Chaytor in despair. &quot;Why did you not tell me of it months ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because I hoped by other speculations to set myself straight.
But everything has gone wrong--everything. Understand, I cannot trouble myself
about your affairs; I have enough to do with my own. I have one satisfaction;
your mother will not suffer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The settlement I made upon her in the days of my prosperity
is hers absolutely, and only she can deal with it. In the settlement of my
business there shall be no sentimental folly; I will see to that. Her money
shall not go to pay my debts.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But it shall go,&quot; thought Chaytor, with secret joy, &quot;to get
me out of the scrape I am in. It belongs to me by right. <i>I</i> will see that
neither you nor your creditors tamper with it.&quot; He breathed more freely; he
could still defy the world.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not told you quite all,&quot; continued Mr. Chaytor. &quot;Here
is a letter from Messrs. Rivington, Sons, and Rivington, advising me that it
will be better for all parties that you do not make your appearance in their
office. Indeed, the place you occupied there is already filled up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do they give any reason for it?&quot; asked Chaytor, inwardly not
greatly astonished at his dismissal.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None; nor shall I ask any questions of them or you. You know
how the land lies. Good morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He unlocked the door, and left the house. This was just what
Chaytor desired. His vicious mind was quick in expedients; his mother was his
shield and his anchor. Her settlement would serve for many a long day yet. To
her he went, and related his troubles in his own way. She gave him, as usual,
her fullest sympathy, and promised all he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Between ourselves, mother,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, my darling, between ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Father must not know. He was always hard on me. He thinks he
can manage everybody's affairs, but he cannot manage his own.&quot; Then he disclosed
to her his father's difficulties. &quot;If he had allowed me to manage for him it
would not have happened. Trust everything to me, mother, and this day year I
will treble your little fortune for you. Let me have a chance for once. When I
have made all our fortunes you shall go to him and say, 'See what Newman has
done for us.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be exactly as you say, darling. You are the best,
the handsomest, the cleverest son a foolish mother ever had.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Kisses and caresses sealed the bargain. Within twenty-four
hours he knew that everything his father had told him was true. The family were
ruined, and but for Mrs. Chaytor's private fortune would have been utterly
beggared. They moved into a smaller house and practised economy. Little by
little Chaytor received and squandered every shilling his mother possessed, and
before the year was out the sun rose upon a ship beating on the rocks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; asked his father, from whom Chaytor's
doings could no longer be concealed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Satisfied!&quot; cried Chaytor, trembling in every limb. &quot;When
your insane speculations have ruined us!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he fell into a chair and began to sob. He had the best of
reasons for tribulation. With his mind's eye he saw the prison doors open to
receive him. It was not shame that made him suffer; it was fear.</p>

<p class="normal">Again, and for the last time, he went to his mother for help.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What can I do, my boy?&quot; quavered the poor woman. &quot;What can I
do? I haven't a shilling in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He implored her to go to his father. &quot;He can save me,&quot; cried
the terror-stricken wretch. &quot;He can, he can!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She obeyed him and the father sent for his son.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell me all,&quot; he said. &quot;Conceal nothing, or, as there is a
heaven above us, I leave you to your fate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The shameful story told, the father said, &quot;Things were looking
up with me, but here is another knock-down blow, and from my own flesh and
blood. I accept it, and will submit once more to be ruined by you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bless you, father, bless you,&quot; whined Chaytor, taking his
father's hand and attempting to fondle it. Mr. Chaytor plucked his hand away.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is, however, a condition attached to the promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What condition?&quot; faltered Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That you leave England and never return. Do you hear me?
Never. You will go to the other end of the world, where you will end your days.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To Australia?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To Australia. When you quit this country I wish never to hear
from you; I shall regard you as dead. You shall no longer trade upon your
mother's weak love for you. I will not argue with you. Accept or refuse.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I accept.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very well. Go from this house and never let me look upon your
face again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can I not see my mother?&quot; whined Chaytor, &quot;to wish her
good-bye?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No. You want to hatch further troubles. You shall not do so.
Quit my house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With head bent low in mock humility, Chaytor left the house.
He had no sincere wish to see his mother; he had got out of her all he could,
and she was of no use to him in the future. The promise his father made was
fulfilled; the fresh forgeries he had perpetrated were bought up, but one still
remained of which he had made no mention. This was a bill for a large amount
which he had accepted in the name of Rivington, Sons and Rivington. It had still
two months to run, and Chaytor determined to remain in England till within a
week or two of its becoming due; something might turn up which would enable him
to meet it. He loved the excitement of English life; Australia was banishment;
but perhaps after all, if he were forced to go it might be the making of him. He
had read of rough men making fortunes in a week on the goldfields. Why should
not he?</p>

<p class="normal">The last blow proved too much for Mr. Chaytor; it broke him up
utterly. He was seized with a serious illness which reduced him to imbecility.
The home had to be sold, and he and his wife removed to lodgings, one small room
at the top of a house in a poor neighbourhood. There poverty fell upon them like
a wolf. Five weeks afterwards Chaytor, slouching through the streets on a rainy
night, saw his mother begging in the roadway. The poor soul stood mute, with a
box of matches in her hand. Chaytor turned and fled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am the unluckiest dog that ever was born,&quot; he muttered.
&quot;Just as I was going to see if I could get anything out of her!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was now imperative that he should leave England, and he
managed to get a passage in a sailing vessel as assistant steward at a shilling
a month. He obtained it by means of forged letters of recommendation, and he
went out in a false name. This he would have retained had it not been that
shortly after his arrival in Australia he met a man who had known him in London,
and who addressed him by his proper name. It was not the only inconvenience to
which an alias subjected him. There was only one address in the colonies through
which he could obtain his letters, and that was the Post Office. Obviously, if
he called himself John Smith he could not expect letters to be delivered to him
in the name of Newman Chaytor. Now, he was eager for letters from the old
country; before he left it he had written to his mother to the effect that he
was driven out of it by a hard-hearted father, and that if she had any good news
to communicate to him he would be glad to hear from her. At the same time he
imposed upon her the obligation of not letting anyone know where he was.
Therefore, when his London acquaintance addressed him by his proper name,
saying, &quot;Hallo, Chaytor, old boy!&quot; he said to himself, &quot;Oh hang it! I'll stick
to Newman Chaytor, and chance it. If mother writes to me I shall have to
proclaim myself Chaytor; an alias might get me into all sorts of trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Why did he write to his poor mother, for whom he had not the
least affection, and what did he mean by expecting her to have any good news to
communicate to him? The last time he saw her, was she not begging in the
streets? Well, there was a clear reason; he seldom did anything without one; and
be sure that the kernel of that reason was Self. His father, from the wreck of
his fortune, had managed to preserve a number of shares in some companies which
had failed, among them two mining companies which had come to grief. Now, it had
happened before and might happen again, that companies which were valueless one
day had leaped into favour the next, that shares which yesterday could have been
purchased for a song, to-morrow would be worth thousands of pounds. Suppose that
this happened to the companies, or to one of them, in which his pauper father
held shares. He was his father's only child, and his mother would see that he
was not disinherited. Chaytor was a man who never threw away a chance, and he
would not throw away this, remote as it was. Hence his determination to adhere
at all hazards to his proper name. The perilous excitements of the last two or
three years had driven Basil Whittingham out of his mind, but having more
leisure and less to occupy his thoughts in the colonies, he thought of him now
and then, and wondered whether the old uncle had relented and had taken his
nephew again into his favour. &quot;Lucky young beggar,&quot; he thought. &quot;I wish I stood
in his shoes, and he in mine. I would soon work the old codger into a proper
mood.&quot; His colonial career was neither profitable nor creditable, and he had
degenerated into what he was when he and Basil came face to face in Gum Flat, an
unadulterated gambler and loafer. The strange encounter awoke within him forces
which had long lain dormant. He recognised a possible chance which might be
worked to his benefit, and he fastened to it like a limpet. When he said to
Basil that he was in luck be really meant it.</p>

<p class="normal">A word as to his false beard and whiskers. In London he had
had a behind-the-scenes acquaintance, and in a private theatrical performance in
which he played a part he had worn these identical appendages as an adjunct to
the character he represented. He had brought them out with him, thinking they
might be serviceable one day. Before he came to Gum Flat he had got into a
scrape on another township, and when he left it, had assumed the false hair as a
kind of disguise. Making his appearance on Gum Flat thus disguised, he deemed it
prudent to retain it, and when he came into association with Basil he thanked
his stars that he had done so; otherwise he might have drawn upon himself from
the man he called his double a closer attention than he desired.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_12" href="#div1Ref_12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">In the middle of the night Basil awoke. He had had a tiring
day, but when he had slept off the first effects of the fatigue he had
undergone, the exciting events of the last two days became again the dominant
power. He dreamt of all that had occurred from the interview between himself and
Anthony Bidaud, in which he had accepted the guardianship of Annette, to the
moment of his arrival on Gum Flat. Of Newman Chaytor he dreamt not at all; this
new acquaintance had produced no abiding impression upon him.</p>

<p class="normal">He lay awake for some five minutes or so in that condition of
quiescent wonder which often falls upon men when they are sleeping for the first
time in a strange bed and in a place with which they are not familiar. Where was
he? What was the position of the bed? Where was the door situated: at the foot,
or the head, or the side of the bed? Was there a window in the apartment, and if
so, where was it? Then came the mental question what had aroused him?</p>

<p class="normal">It was so unusual for him to wake in the middle of the night
that he dwelt upon this question. Something must have disturbed him. What?</p>

<p class="normal">Was it fancy that just at the moment of his awakening he had
heard a movement in the room, that he had felt a hand upon him, that he had
heard a man's breathing? It must have been, all was so quiet and still. Suddenly
he sat straight up on the stretcher. He remembered that he was in the township
of Gum Flat, sleeping in a strange apartment, and that men with whom he had not
been favourably impressed must be lying near him. This did not apply to Newman
Chaytor, who had been kind and attentive, and whom he now thought of with
gratitude. There was nothing to fear from him, but the other three had gazed at
him furtively and with no friendly feelings. He had exchanged but a few words
with these men, and those had been words of suspicion. When he entered the
store, after attending to his horse, they had not addressed a word to him. It
was Chaytor, and Chaytor alone, who had shown kindness and evinced a kindly
feeling. And now he was certain that someone had been in the room while he
slept, and had laid hands on him. For what purpose?</p>

<p class="normal">He slid from the stretcher, and standing upright stretched out
his hands in the darkness. Where was the door?</p>

<p class="normal">Outside the canvas building stood Chaytor's three mates, wide
awake, with their heads close together, as they had been inside on the return of
Basil and Chaytor from the stable. They were conversing in whispers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did he hear you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No. If he had moved I would have knocked him on the head.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you got it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, it is all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pass it round.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; I will keep it till it's sold; then we'll divide
equally.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you think it's worth?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Twenty pounds, I should say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Little enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hush!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The sound of Basil moving about his room, groping for the
door, had reached them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If he comes out, Jim, you tackle him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Leave him to me. Don't waste any more time. Get the horse
from the stable.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil, unable to find the door, stumbled against the calico
portion which divided his room from that in which Chaytor slept.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who's there?&quot; cried Chaytor, jumping up.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, it's you,&quot; said Basil, recognising the voice. &quot;Have you
got a light?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Wait a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But half dressed he represented himself to Basil, with a
lighted candle in his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What's up?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't know,&quot; replied Basil, &quot;but I am not easy in my mind.
Perhaps it is only my fancy, but I have an idea that someone has been in my
room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let us see.&quot; They proceeded to the three compartments which
should have been occupied by the three men. They were empty.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was not fancy,&quot; said Basil. &quot;What mischief are they up to?
Come along; we will go and see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor hesitated. He was not gifted with heroic qualities,
and he knew that his three mates were desperate characters.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you have any money about you?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None. Why, where's my watch?&quot; It was gone. There was a
hurried movement without; he heard the sound of a horse's feet. &quot;They are
stealing Corrie's horse,&quot; he cried, &quot;after robbing me of my watch! Stand by me,
will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He rushed out, followed, but not too quickly, by Chaytor. The
moment he reached the open a pair of arms was thrown around him, and he was
grappling with an enemy. In unfamiliar ground, enveloped in darkness, and
attacked by an unseen enemy, he was at a disadvantage, and it would have fared
ill with him had he not been strong and stout-hearted. Jim the Hatter, who had
undertaken to tackle him soon discovered that the man they were robbing was not
easily disposed of. Down they fell the pair of them, twisting and turning, each
striving to obtain the advantage, Basil silent and resolved, Jim the Hatter
giving tongue to many an execration. In the midst of the struggle the ruffian
heard his mates, the Nonentities, moving off with Basil's horse. His experience
had taught him that &quot;honour among thieves&quot; was a fallacious proverb; anyway, he
had never practised it himself, and he trusted no men. With a powerful effort he
threw Basil from him and ran after his comrades. During the encounter Chaytor
had kept at a safe distance, but now that there was a lull he came close to
Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They have half throttled me,&quot; he gasped, tearing open his
shirt and blowing like a grampus. &quot;Are you hurt?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Basil. &quot;We may catch them yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And he began to run, but the ruffians had got the start of
him, and knew the lay of the ground. Guided by his ear he stumbled on, across
the plains, through a gully riddled with holes, and finally up a steep range,
followed by Chaytor, panting and blowing. He had many a fall, and so had Chaytor
(who thought it well to follow suit, and cried out from time to time, &quot;O, O,
O!&quot;), and thus the flight and the pursuit continued, the sounds from the flying
men and Old Corrie's horse growing fainter and fainter, until matters came to a
sudden termination.</p>

<p class="normal">Half-way up the range, which was veined with quartz, a shaft
had been sunk and abandoned. The miners who had done the work had followed a
gold-bearing spur some fifty feet down, in the hope of coming upon a golden
reef. But the spur grew thinner and thinner, the traces of gold disappeared, and
they lost heart. Disappointed in their expectations, and out of patience with
their profitless labour, they shouldered their windlass and started off to fresh
pastures. Thus the mouth of the shaft was left open and unprotected, and into it
Basil dropped, and felt himself slipping down with perilous celerity.</p>

<p class="normal">It was fortunate that the shaft was not exactly perpendicular,
After following the spur down for twenty feet the miners had found that it took
an eccentric turn which necessitated the running in of an adit. This passage was
about two yards long, when the spur dipped again, and the shaft was continued
sheer into the bowels of the earth. It was this adit which saved Basil's life.
When he had slipped down the twenty feet he felt bottom, and there he lay,
bruised, but not dangerously hurt.</p>

<p class="normal">He cried out for help at the top of his voice, and his cries
were presently answered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Below there!&quot; cried Chaytor, lying flat on the ground above,
with his ear at the mouth of the shaft.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is that you, Mr. Chaytor?&quot; cried Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor (aside): &quot;He remembers my name.&quot; (Aloud): &quot;Yes, what's
left of me. Where are you?&quot; (Which, to say the least of it, was an unnecessary
question.)</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;Down here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor (blind to logical fact): &quot;Alive?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil (perceiving nothing strange in the question, and
therefore almost as blind): &quot;Yes, thank God!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;Any bones broke?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;I think not, but I am bruised a bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;So am I.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;I am sorry to hear it. Have the scoundrels got away?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;Yes, they're a mile off by this time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil (groaning): &quot;Old Corrie's mare! What will he think of
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;It can't be helped.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;In which direction have they gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;Haven't the slightest idea. I warned you against
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;You did. You're a good fellow, but what could I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;Neither of us could have prevented it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;I am not so sure. I ought to have stopped up all
night, and looked after what wasn't my own.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor (attempting consolation): &quot;Why, you couldn't keep your
eyes open.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil (groaning again): &quot;I ought to have kept my eyes open. I
had no right to sleep after your warning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;I did what I could.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;You did; you're a true friend.&quot; (Chaytor smiled.) &quot;How
am I to get up from here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;That's the question. How far are you down?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;Heaven knows. It seems a mile or so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;There's no windlass.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;Isn't there?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;And it's pitch dark.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;It's as black as night down here. Can't you go for
help?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;I'll tell you something. There isn't a soul on the
township but ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;Not one?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;Not one. We must wait till daylight; then I'll see
what I can do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;There's no help for it; it must be as you say. You'll
not desert me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor (in an injured tone): &quot;Can you think me capable of so
dastardly an act?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;Forgive me; I hardly know what I'm saying. I deserve
that you should, for giving utterance to a thought so base.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;It was natural, perhaps. Why should you trust me, a
stranger, whom you have known for only a few hours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;I do trust you: it was an unnatural thought. You are a
noble fellow--and a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;I hope so. Can I do anything for you while you are
waiting?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;I am devoured by thirst. Can you manage to get a drink
of water to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;I can do that; but you must have patience. I shall
have to go back to the township to get a bottle and some string. Shall I go?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil: &quot;Yes, yes. Be as quick as you can.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor: &quot;I won't be a moment longer than I can help.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then there was silence. Chaytor departed on his errand, and
Basil was left to himself. His right arm was bruised and sore, but he contrived
to feel in his pockets for matches. A box was there, but it was empty, and he
remembered that he had struck the last one at the end of his long ride from
Bidaud's plantation, just before he arrived in Gum Flat. He knew, from feeling
the opening of the adit, that it was likely he was not at the bottom of the
shaft, and he was fearful of moving, lest he should fall into a pit. He thought
of Newman Chaytor. &quot;What a good fellow he is! I should be dead but for him. It
is truly noble of him to stick to me as he is doing. He has nothing to gain by
it, and he is saving my life. Yes, I will accept his proposal to go mates with
him, for I have no place now on Bidaud's plantation. Poor Annette--poor child! I
hope she will be happy. I hope her uncle and Aunt will be kind to her. I must
see her again before I go for good, and then we shall never meet again, never,
never! I would give the best twenty years of my life--if I am fated to live--to
be her brother, with authority to protect her and shield her from Gilbert
Bidaud. He is a villain, a smooth-tongued villain, a thousand times worse than
these scoundrels who have robbed me and brought me to this. What will Old Corrie
say when he hears I have lost his mare? Will he think I am lying--will he think
I have sold his horse and pocketed the money? If so, and it gets to Annette's
ears, how she will despise me! I must see her, I must, to clear myself. Gilbert
Bidaud will do all he can to prevent it, and he may succeed; but I will try, I
will try. If I had a hundred pounds I would buy another horse for Old Corrie, a
better one than that I have lost, but I haven't a shilling. A sorry plight.
There is only one human being in the world I can call a friend, and that is Mr.
Chaytor, who has taken such a strange fancy for me. Yesterday there was Old
Corrie, there was Anthony Bidaud, there was Annette. One is dead, the others may
cast me off, It is a cruel world. How long Mr. Chaytor is! It seems an age.
Shame on you, Basil, for reviling! There is goodness, there is sweetness, there
is faithfulness in the world. Don't whine, old man. All may yet be well, though
for the life of me I can't see how it is to be brought about.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he fainted, but only for a few seconds; when he opened
his eyes again he thought hours must have elapsed.</p>

<p class="normal">In truth Chaytor was absent no longer than was necessary, but
he was also mentally busy with the adventures of the last few hours. The man
whose phantom shadow had haunted him in London was now at his mercy. Basil's
life was absolutely at his disposal. To leave him where he was in that desolate
spot at the bottom of a deserted shaft would be to ensure for him a sure and
certain death, and if he wished to make assurance doubly sure, all he had to do
would be to roll a great stone upon him. But that would be a crime, and,
hardened as he was, he shrank from committing it. Not from any impulse of mercy,
but because he had nothing at present to gain from it. There was much to learn,
much to do before he nerved himself to a desperate deed which, after all, might
by some stroke of good fortune be unnecessary. And indeed it was only the
accident which had befallen Basil that darkened his soul with cruel suggestion.
The sleeping forces which lurk in the souls of such men as Newman Chaytor often
leap into active life by some unfortuitous circumstance in which they have no
direct hand.</p>

<p class="normal">He was back at the shaft, leaning over it, with a bottle of
water not too tightly corked, to the neck of which was attached a long piece of
cord.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you there?&quot; he called out.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Heaven be thanked!&quot; said Basil. &quot;What a time you have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not been away an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is that really so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is, but it must have seemed long to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Weeks seem to have passed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have a bottle of water which I will send down to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God bless you!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When you get it, loosen the string from the neck of the
bottle, and I will send down what remains of the flask of brandy. It will do you
no harm.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can never repay you for your goodness to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, you can. Look out.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The bottle of water was lowered, and afterwards the flask of
brandy: Basil took a long draught of water, half emptying the bottle, and sipped
sparingly of the brandy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have given me life, Mr. Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Psha! I have done nothing worth making a fuss about. Oblige
me by dropping the Mr.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will. With all my heart and soul I thank you, Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are heartily welcome, Basil. There is a light coming into
the sky.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sunrise! How beautiful the world is!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Listen,&quot; said Chaytor; &quot;I will tell you what I am going to
do.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_13" href="#div1Ref_13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am listening,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is no windlass, as I have told you,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;so
I must devise something in its place to pull you up. The mischief is that I am
alone, and have no one to help me. However, I must do the best I can. I am going
to roll the trunk of a tree to the top of the shaft, then tie a rope firmly
round it so that you can climb into the world again. It must be dreadful down
there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is,&quot; groaned Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can imagine it,&quot; said Chaytor, complacently; &quot;but you
mustn't mind biding a bit. No man could do more than I am doing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed he could not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The tree is six or seven hundred yards off, and I daresay I
shall be an hour over the job. I can't help that, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course you can't. I can't find words to express my
gratitude for all the trouble you are taking. And for a stranger, too!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't look upon you as a stranger; I feel as if I had known
you all my life. I suppose, though, it is really but the commencement of a
friendship which will last I hope till we are both old men.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope so too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A little while ago I was saying to myself, I will never trust
another man as long as I live; I will never believe in another; I will never
again confide in man or woman. I have been deceived, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am truly sorry to hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I have been deceived. Friend after friend have I
trusted, have I helped, have I ruined myself for, to find them in the end false,
selfish and unreliable. I was filled with disgust and with shame for my species.
'I renounce you all,' I cried in the bitterness of my soul. But now everything
seems changed. Since you came my faith in human goodness and sincerity and truth
is restored. I don't know why, but it is so. I can rely upon your friendship,
Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can. I will never forget your goodness; never.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am going, now, to roll the tree to the shaft. Be as patient
as you can.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He did not go far. The slim trunk that he spoke of lay not six
or seven hundred yards off, but quite close to the shaft, and he knew that Basil
in his pursuit of the robbers could not have observed it. He was master of the
situation; Basil was at his mercy, and every word he had uttered was intended to
bind the unsuspicious man more firmly to him. &quot;He is a soft-hearted fool,&quot;
thought Chaytor, &quot;and I shall be able to bend him any way I please through the
gratitude he feels for me. I think I spoke rather well. What is this?&quot; He
stooped and picked up a pocket-book which had slipped from Basil's pocket as he
ran after the thieves.</p>

<p class="normal">Retreating still farther from the shaft, to make assurance
doubly sure, Chaytor, with eager fingers and a greedy expectancy in his eyes
opened the book and examined the contents. Intrinsically they were of no value,
but in their relation to the unformed design which was prompting Chaytor's
actions their value was inestimable. There were memoranda of dates, events,
names and addresses, and also some old letters. Any possible use of the latter
did not occur to Chaytor, but his examination of the former was almost instantly
suggestive. They were in Basil's handwriting, some being dated and signed &quot;B.
W.&quot;, and would serve admirably as copies for anyone who desired to imitate the
writing. Clear up and down strokes, without twists or eccentric curves,
straightforward as Basil himself. &quot;This is a find,&quot; thought Chaytor; &quot;Providence
is certainly on my side. In a week I shall be able to write so exactly like
Basil that he will be ready to swear my writing is his. There is information,
too, in the book which may prove serviceable. I'll stick to him while there's a
chance, and contrive so that he shall stick to me. I haven't done badly up to
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">More than an hour did Chaytor employ in cunning cogitation,
smoking the while in a state of comfortable haziness as to the future.
Imagination gilded the prospect and clothed it with alluring fancies; and that
the roads which led to it were dark and devious did not deter him from revelling
in the contemplation. Time was up. Panting and blowing, he rolled the tree-trunk
to the shaft.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Below there!&quot; he called out.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot; replied Basil; &quot;you are back again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have had a terrible job,&quot; said the hypocrite, &quot;and almost
despaired of accomplishing it, but stout heart and willing hands put strength
into a fellow, and the tree is here. Look out for yourself while I roll it
across the shaft. The earth may be rotten, and some bits will roll down,
perhaps, though I'll do all I can to prevent it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you, a thousand, thousand times. There's a little
tunnel here; I'll get into it while you're at work above.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With loud evidences of arduous toil Chaytor placed the trunk
in position, and then made the rope secure around it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;all is ready, Basil, and I'm going to
lower the rope. Have you got it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Basil, in a faint tone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will have to pull yourself up by it. I will keep the rope
as tight and steady as I can, and that is as much as I can do. Do you think you
will be able to manage it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must try, but I feel very weak. My strength is giving way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't let it, old fellow. Pluck up courage; it's only for a
few minutes, and then you will be safe at the top. Now then, with a will.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It required a will on Basil's part, he was so weak, and more
than once he feared that it was all over with him; but at length the difficult
feat was accomplished, and, with daylight shining once more on him, he reached
the top, and was pulled from the mouth of the shaft by Chaytor's strong arms.
Then, his strength quite gone, he sank lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor, gazing upon the helpless form, reflected. He had
Basil's pocket-book packed safely away in an inner pocket of his waistcoat, one
of those pockets which men who have anything to conceal, or who move in lawless
places, have made in their garments. This book contained much that might be
useful; for instance, the correct name and address of Basil's uncle in England,
a statement of the debts which Basil had paid to keep his dead father's name
clear from reproach, the address of the lawyers who had managed that
transaction, the amount of the fortune that Basil's mother had bequeathed to
him, and other such matters. Now, had Basil anything more upon his person which
might be turned to account in the future? If so, this was a favourable
opportunity for Chaytor to possess himself of it. There would be no difficulty
in satisfactorily explaining the loss of any property which Basil had about him.
In the confusion and excitement of the last few hours anything might have
happened.</p>

<p class="normal">Having decided the point, Chaytor's unscrupulous fingers
became busy, and every article in Basil's pockets passed through his hands. With
the exception of a purse, he replaced everything he had taken out. This purse
contained a locket with a lock of hair in it: at the back of the locket was an
inscription in Basil's writing--&quot;My dear Mother's hair,&quot; her Christian name, the
date of her death, and her age. There was no money in the purse. Undoubtedly
Basil, when he recovered his senses, would miss his purse, but if his
pocket-book slipped out of his pocket while running, why not that? Chaytor was
perfectly easy in his mind as he deposited the purse by the side of the
pocket-book inside his waistcoat.</p>

<p class="normal">Meanwhile Basil lay motionless. &quot;I'll carry him a little way,&quot;
thought Chaytor. &quot;Anything might drop from his clothes while he is hanging over
my shoulder. I'll have as many arrows to my bow as I can manufacture. When he
gets to his senses we will have a hunt for the purse and the pocket-book, and of
course shall not find them.&quot; With a grim smile he raised Basil to a sitting
posture, and gradually lifted him on to his shoulder. Clasping him firmly round
the body, Chaytor staggered on.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil was no light weight, and Chaytor, while he was pursuing
his dissipated life in London, had not been renowned for strength; but his
colonial career had hardened his muscles, and enabled him now to perform a task
which in years gone by would have been impossible. A dozen times he stopped to
rest and wipe his brows. The form he carried was helpless and inert, but Basil's
mind was stirred by the motion of being carried through the fresh air, and he
began to babble. He thought he was upon old Corrie's mare, and he urged the
animal on, muttering in disjointed and unconnected words that he must reach the
township of Gum Flat that night, and be back again next day. Then he went on to
babble about Annette and her father, and to a less intelligent man than
Chaytor--give him credit for that--his wandering talk might have been incoherent
and meaningless. But Chaytor's intellect was refined and sharpened by the
possibilities of a gilded future. He listened attentively to every word that
fell from Basil's fevered lips, and put meaning to them, sometimes false
sometimes true.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My friend Basil is in a delirium,&quot; said he during the
intervals of Basil's muttering, &quot;and I shall have to nurse him through a fever
most likely. What with that probability, and the weight of him, I am earning my
wage. No man can dispute that. He raves like a man in love about this Annette.
How old is she? Is she pretty? Does she love him? Will she be rich? Is that a
vein I could work to profit? I don't intend to throw away the shadow of a
chance. An age seems to have passed since last night. But what,&quot; he cried
suddenly, &quot;if all my labour is being thrown away--what if I am following a
will-o'-the-wisp?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He let Basil slip purposely from his arms, and heedless of the
sick man's groans, for the fall was violent, he looked down upon him as though a
mortal enemy was in his path. But one of the strongest elements in greed and
avarice is the hope that leads their votaries on, and this and the superstitious
feeling that the meeting had been brought about by fate, and was but the
beginning of a fruitful end, dispelled the doubt that had arisen. &quot;I will work
for it,&quot; he muttered; &quot;It is my only chance. Even if nothing comes of it I shall
be no worse off. But something <i>shall</i> come of it--I swear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Reassured, he took up his burden, and in the course of an hour
reached the dwelling they had occupied the previous night. By that time Basil
was in a high fever, and Chaytor began to be disturbed by the fear that his
double would die. Then, indeed, his labour would be lost and his hopes
destroyed, for he had much to learn and much to do before the vague design which
spurred him on could be developed and ripened.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor had a secret store of provisions which he had hoarded
up unknown to Jim the Hatter and the Nonentities; some tins of preserved meat
and soup, the remains of a sack of flour, two or three pounds of tea, a few
bottles of spirits, and a supply of tobacco. These would have served for a
longer time than Basil's sickness lasted, and Chaytor comforted himself with the
reflection that he could not have carried them away with him had he been
compelled to leave the deserted township. It was really Basil's stout and
healthy constitution that pulled him through a fever which would have proved
fatal to many men. He did not recover his senses for sixteen days, and as he had
nothing to conceal he, during that time, revealed to Chaytor in his wild
wandering much of his early life. When at length he opened his eyes, and they
fell with dawning consciousness upon the man standing beside his bed, Chaytor
was in possession of particulars innocent enough in themselves, but dangerous if
intended to be used to a wily and dangerous end. During those sixteen days
Chaytor had not been idle, having employed himself industriously in studying and
imitating the few peculiarities in Basil's writing. To a past-master like
himself this was not difficult, and he succeeded in producing an imitation so
perfect as to deceive anyone familiar with Basil's style. He was careful in
destroying every evidence of this vile study.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil's eyes fell upon Chaytor's face, and he was silent
awhile. Chaytor also. Basil closed his eyes, opened them again, and fell to once
more pondering upon matters. Then Chaytor spoke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know me at last?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Know you! At last!&quot; echoed Basil. &quot;I have seen you
before--but where?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here, in Gum Flat township.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am in Gum Flat township. Yes, I remember, I was riding that
way on old Corrie's mare.&quot; He jumped up, or rather tried to do so, his weak
state frustrating his intention.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where are the robbers?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's the question,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;and echo answers. Not
very satisfactory.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is coming back to me little by little,&quot; said Basil
presently. &quot;I arrived here late at night and found the township deserted by all
but four men, three of them scoundrels, the fourth a noble fellow whose name
was--was--what has happened to me that my memory plays me tricks? I have it
now--whose name was Newman Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A true bill. He stands before you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are the man. What occurred next? He found a stable for
Old Corrie's mare, gave me food and a bed, while the three scoundrels looked on
frowning. I slept like an unfaithful steward; the mare being Corrie's and not
mine, and I doubtful of the character and intentions of the scoundrels, I should
have kept watch over property that did not belong to me. Instead of doing that I
consulted my own ease and pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You could not help it; you were tired out.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No excuse. I made no attempt to guard Old Corrie's mare. If I
had watched and fallen asleep from weariness at my post it might have been
another matter. When I present myself to Old Corrie, that is if I am ever able
to stand upon my legs again I shall put no gloss upon my conduct. He shall hear
the plain unvarnished truth from the unfaithful steward's own lips. I am
unworthy of confidence or friendship; I warn you, Newman Chaytor, put no trust
in me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would trust you,&quot; said Chaytor, with well-simulated
candour, &quot;with my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The more fool you. Where was I? Oh, asleep in the comfortable
bed you gave me while these scoundrels were planning robbery. In the middle of
the night I woke up--pitch dark it was----forgive me for speaking ungratefully
to you. My heart is overflowing with gratitude, but I am at the same time filled
with remorse.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't trouble about that, Basil,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;You can't
hurt yourself in my esteem. Go on with your reminiscence; it is a healthy
exercise; it will strengthen your wandering memory.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pitch dark it was. I was not sure then, but I am now, that
thieves had been in my room. Have I been lying here long, Chaytor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Two weeks and more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you have been nursing me all that time?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As well as I could. You could have found no other
nurse--though easy to find a better--in Gum Flat; you and I are the only two
living humans in the township.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why did you not leave me to die?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because I am not quite a brute.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forgive me for provoking such a reply. But why--indeed, why
have you been so good to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will answer you honestly, Basil. Because I love you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He lowered his voice and bent his eyes to the ground as he
made the false statement; and Basil turned his head, and a little sob escaped
him at the expression of devotion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope I may live to repay you,&quot; he said, holding out his
hand, which Chaytor seized.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will. All I ask of you is not to desert me. Stick to me
as a friend, as I have stuck to you; I have been so basely deceived in
friendship that my faith in human goodness would be irrevocably shattered if you
prove false.&quot; His voice faltered; tears came into his eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That will I never do. My life is yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I want your heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have it. The world contains no nobler man than my friend,
Newman Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am well repaid. Now you must rest; you have talked enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I will finish first. Hearing sounds outside the tent I
called for your assistance. We went out together and were immediately attacked.
Were you much hurt, Chaytor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A little,&quot; replied Chaytor, modestly. &quot;A scratch or two not
worth mentioning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is like you to make light of your own injuries. We pursued
the scoundrels through the darkness, but they knew the ground they were
travelling, we did not. An uncovered shaft lay in my way, and down I fell. That
is all I remember. But I know that my bones would be bleaching there at the
present moment if it had not been for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Try to remember a little more,&quot; said Chaytor, anxious that
not a grain of credit should be lost to him. &quot;I came up to the shaft sorely
bruised, and called out to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes, it comes back to me. You brought me some
brandy--you cheered and comforted me--you rolled the trunk of a tree over the
mouth of the shaft--it was half a mile away--and after hours of terrible agony I
was brought into the sweet light of day. But for you I should have died. Indeed
and indeed, I remember nothing more. You must tell me the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This Chaytor did with an affectation of modesty, but with
absolute exaggeration of the services he had rendered, and Basil lay and
listened, and his heart went out to the man who had proved so devoted a friend,
and had sacrificed so much for his sake.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My gratitude is yours to my dying day,&quot; he said. &quot;No man ever
did for another what you have done for me. Give me my clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are not strong enough yet to get up, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't want to get up. I want to see what the scoundrels
have left in my pockets.&quot; He felt, and cried: &quot;Everything gone! my purse, my
pocket-book, everything--even a lock of my mother's hair. They might have left
me that!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They made a clean sweep, I suppose,&quot; said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">He had considered this matter while Basil lay unconscious, and
had come to the conclusion that it would be wiser to strip Basil's pockets bare
than to make a selection of one or two things, which was scarcely what a thief
in his haste would have done. Thus it was that Basil found his pockets
completely empty.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have for a friend the neediest beggar that ever drew
breath,&quot; said Basil bitterly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll put up with that,&quot; said Chaytor, with great
cheerfulness. &quot;Now, don't worry yourself about anything whatever. You shall
share with me to the last pipe of tobacco, and when that's gone we will work for
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, tobacco! Would a whiff or two do me any harm?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you good. You'll have to smoke out of my pipe; the
villains have stolen yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He filled his pipe, and, giving it to Basil, held a lighted
match to the tobacco. Basil, lying on his side, watched the curling smoke as it
floated above his head. Distressed as he was, the evidences of Newman Chaytor's
goodness were to some extent a compensating balance to his troubles. And now he
was enjoying the soothing influence of a quiet smoke. Those persons who regard
the weed as noxious and baleful have a perfect right to their opinion, but they
cannot ignore the fact that to many thousands of thousands of estimable beings
it serves as a comforter, frequently indeed as a healer. It was so in the
present instance. As the smoke wreathed and curled above him an ineffable
consolation crept into Basil's soul. Things seemed at their blackest; the peace
and hope of a bright future had been destroyed; the man who had grown to honour
him, and who had assured him of the future, had with awful suddenness breathed
his last breath; the little child he loved, and to whom he was to have been
guardian and protector, was thrust into the care of a malignant, remorseless
man; suspicion of foul play had been thrown upon him; Old Corrie had lent him
his mare, and he had allowed it to be stolen; he had been so near to death that
but one man, and he a short time since an utter stranger, stood between him and
eternity; and he was lying now on a bed of sickness an utter, utter beggar. Grim
enough in all conscience, but the simple smoking of a pipe put a different and a
better aspect upon it. There was hope in the future; he was young, he would get
well and strong again; Anthony Bidaud was dead, but spiritual comfort died not
with life; he would see Annette once more, and would take his leave of her
assured of her love, so far as a child could give such an assurance, and in the
hope of meeting her again in years to come; he would outlive the injurious
suspicion of wrong-dealing which he did not doubt Gilbert Bidaud was spreading
against him; and he would be able to vindicate himself in Old Corrie's eyes and
perhaps by-and-by recompense the old fellow for the loss of the more. Much
virtue in a pipe when it can so transform the prospect stretching before a man
brought to such a pass as Basil had been.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said aloud, &quot;all will come right in the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course it will,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;What special mental
question are you answering?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing special. I was thinking in a general way of my
troubles, and your pipe has put a more cheerful colour on them. Am I mistaken in
thinking you told me you were a doctor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No. That is why I have been able to pull you through so
quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How long will it be before I am able to get about?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At the end of the week if you will be reasonable.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I promise. I feel well already. The moment I am strong enough
I must go to Bidaud's plantation.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will go with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course. We are mates from this day forth. The end of the
week? Not earlier?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't be impatient. My plan is to make a perfect cure. No
patching. At present I am in command.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I obey. But let it be as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor congratulated himself. However things turned out in
the future, all had gone on swimmingly up to this moment. Every little move he
had made had been successful. Basil had not the slightest suspicion that it was
he who had stolen his pocket-book and purse, and emptied his pockets.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If an angel from heaven,&quot; chuckled Chaytor that night, as he
walked to and fro outside the store, &quot;came and told him the truth, he would not
believe it. I have him under my thumb--under my thumb. How to work his old uncle
in England? How to get hold of that forty thousand pounds? It must not go out of
the family; I will not submit to it. Would a letter or two from Basil, written
by me in Basil's hand, do any good? I don't mind eating any amount of humble pie
to accomplish my purpose. Even were it not a vicarious humiliation I am willing
to do it, the money being guided into its proper channel, and Basil safely out
of the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He paused, with a sinister look in his eyes. Had Basil seen
him then he would hardly have recognised him. Dark thoughts flitted through his
mind, and animated his features.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing shall stop me,&quot; he cried, &quot;nothing!&quot; And he raised
his hands to the skies as though registering an oath. A sad cloud stole upon the
moon and obscured its light. &quot;What is life without enjoyment?&quot; he muttered. &quot;By
fair means or foul I mean to enjoy. I should like to know what we are sent into
the world for if we are deprived of a fair share of the best things?&quot; There
being no one to answer him, he presently went inside to bed.</p>

<p class="normal">The next day Basil was so much better that without asking
permission he got up and dressed himself. Chaytor did not remonstrate with him;
he knew, now that Basil was mending, that he would mend quickly. So it proved;
before the week was out the two men set forth on the tramp to Bidaud's
plantations.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_14" href="#div1Ref_14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">At noon on the second day they were within hail of Old
Corrie's hut. It was meal time, and the old woodman was cooking his dinner.
Balanced on the blazing log was a frying-pan filled with mutton-chops, some
half-dozen or so, which were not more than enough for a tough-limbed fellow
working from sunrise till sunset in the open air. He looked up as Basil and
Chaytor approached, and with a nod of his head proceeded to turn the frizzling
chops in the pan. This was his way; he was the reverse of demonstrative.</p>

<p class="normal">Such a greeting from another man, and that man a friend, would
have disconcerted Basil, but he was familiar with Old Corrie's peculiarities and
had it not been for his own inward disquiet regarding the mare, he would have
felt quite at his ease.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Back again,&quot; said Old Corrie, transferring a couple of chops
on to a tin plate.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Been away longer than you expected.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On the tramp?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Look here, Corrie--&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's no hurry,&quot; interrupted Old Corrie. &quot;You must be
hungry. Go inside, and you'll see half a sheep dressed. Cut off what you want
and cook it while the fire serves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But I would rather say first what I have to say. When I've
told you all, my mate and I might not be welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't risk it, then. Never run to court trouble, Master
Basil. I'm an older man than you; take the advice I give you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is good advice,&quot; said Chaytor, whose appetite was sharp
set, and to whom the smell of the chops was well-nigh maddening.</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie looked at him with penetrating eyes, and Chaytor
bore the gaze well. He was not deficient in a certain quality of courage when he
was out of peril and master of the situation, as he believed himself to be here.
Old Corrie showed no sign of approval or disapproval, but proceeded quietly with
his dinner. Basil took the woodman's advice. He went into the hut, cut a
sufficient number of chops from the half body of the sheep which was hanging up,
and came back and took possession of the frying-pan, which was now at his
disposal. Chaytor looked on; he had not been made exactly welcome, and was in
doubt of Old Corrie's opinion of him, therefore he did not feel warranted in
making himself at home. When the young men commenced their meal, Old Corrie had
finished his, and now, pipe in mouth, he leant his back against a great tree and
contemplated his guests.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Little lady! Little lady!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The sound came from within the hut. Chaytor started, Basil
looked up with a piece of mutton between his thumb and knife: forks they had
none.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil! Basil! Basil and Annette! Little lady! Little lady!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's the magpie I told you about,&quot; said Old Corrie to Basil,
&quot;the last time I saw you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Its vocabulary is extended,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By request,&quot; said Old Corrie in a pleasant voice, &quot;of the
little lady herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil glowed. Annette had not forgotten him, even thought
kindly of him; otherwise, why should she wish that the bird Old Corrie was
training for her should become familiar with his name? Chaytor smarted under a
sense of injury. Basil and Old Corrie were speaking of something which he did
not understand--a proof that Basil had not told him everything. This, in
Chaytor's estimation, was underhanded and injurious. Basil and everything in
relation to him, his antecedents, his whole story, belonged by right to him,
Newman Chaytor, who had saved his life, who had the strongest claim of gratitude
upon him which a man could possible have. Old Corrie noted the vindictive flash
in his eyes, but made no comment upon it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And is that really a bird?&quot; said Chaytor, in a tone of polite
inquiry.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go and see for yourself,&quot; replied Old Corrie, &quot;but don't go
too close. It hasn't the best of tempers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should like to see the bird that could frighten me,&quot; said
Chaytor, rising.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Should you?&quot; said Old Corrie. &quot;Then on second thoughts I
prefer that you stay where you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor laughed and resumed his seat. The meal proceeded in
silence after this, and when the last chop was disposed of, Old Corrie said,
&quot;Now we will have our chat, Master Basil; and as we've a few private matters to
talk of, our mate here perhaps----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The hint was plain, though imperfectly expressed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am in the way,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;I'll smoke my pipe in the
woods. Coo-ey when you want me, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He strode off; exterior genial and placid, interior like a
volcano. &quot;He shall pay for it,&quot; was his thought. It pleased him to garner up a
store of imaginary injuries which were to be requited in the future. Then, when
the time arrived for him to deal a blow, it would be merely giving tit for tat.
Many men besides Chaytor reason in this crooked way, but none whose natures and
motives are honourable and straightforward.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where did you pick him up?&quot; asked Old Corrie when he and
Basil were alone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I want to speak to you first about your mare,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I want to know first where you picked up your new mate,&quot;
persisted Corrie.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He saved my life,&quot; said Basil. &quot;Had it not been for his great
and unselfish kindness I should not be here to-day.&quot; Then he told the woodman
all that he knew of Chaytor, and dilated in glowing terms upon his noble
conduct.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It sounds well,&quot; said Old Corrie, &quot;and I have nothing to say
in contradiction; only I have a crank in me. I look into a man's face and I like
him, and I look into a man's face and I don't like him. The first time I clapped
eyes on you, Master Basil, I took a fancy to you. I can't say the same for your
mate, but let it stand. I had it in my mind to make a proposition to you in case
you came back in time, but I doubt whether it can be carried out now. Have you
entered into a bargain to go mates with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have, and have no wish to break it. I should be the basest
of men if I tried to throw him over.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Keep to your word, lad; I'm the loser, for I thought it
likely the two of us might strike up a partnership.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why not the three of us?&quot; asked Basil, to whom the prospect
of working with Old Corrie was very agreeable.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because in the first place it wouldn't suit me, and in the
second it wouldn't suit him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But if he were willing?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie bent his brows kindly upon Basil's ingenuous face.
&quot;Ask him, Master Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you not listen to me first? I want to speak to you about
your mare.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A quarter of an hour more or less won't bring her back, will
it?&quot; said Old Corrie, with no touch of reproach in his voice. &quot;Go and speak to
your mate, and let me know what he says.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil departed and returned. It was as Old Corrie supposed:
Chaytor was not willing to admit Corrie into their partnership.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He says you took a dislike to him from the first,&quot; said
Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Almost my own words,&quot; said Old Corrie, with a laugh. &quot;He's a
shrewd customer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;----And that he is certain you and he would not agree. I
would give a finger off each hand if it could have been, for a warmer-hearted
and nobler man does not exist than Chaytor; and as for you, Corrie, I would wish
nothing better. But I am bound to him by the strongest ties of gratitude.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Say no more, Master Basil, say no more. Mayhap we shall meet
by-and-by, and we shall be no worse friends because this has fallen through. We
have a lot to say to each other. I'm off the day after to-morrow; I should have
been off before if it had not been for you and the little lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has been here?&quot; cried Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has been here four times since you left--the last time
yesterday--not to see me, but you. She manages the thing herself, poor little
lady, and comes alone, after giving the slip to those about her. Her first grief
is over, though she will never forget the good father she has lost--never. It
isn't in her nature to forget--bear that in mind, Master Basil. She clings to
the friends that are left her. Friends, did I say? Why, she has only one--you,
Master Basil; I don't count. Besides, if I did it would matter little to her,
for there's nothing more unlikely than that, after two days have gone by, I
shall ever look upon her sweet face again. She goes one way, I go another.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She goes one way?&quot; repeated Basil; &quot;will she not remain on
the plantation?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She will not. You see it isn't for her to choose; she must do
as she is directed. But we are mixing up things, and it will help them right
well if I tell you what I've got to tell straight on, commencing with A, ending
with Z. Let us clear the ground so that the axe may swing without being caught
in loose branches. I'll hear what you've got to say. My mare is lost, I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You would have brought it back with you if it hadn't been.
Now then, lad, straight out, no beating about the bush. It's not in your line. I
don't for a moment mistrust you. There's truth in your face always, Master
Basil, and I wish with all my heart the little lady had you by her side to guide
her instead of the skunk that's stepped into her dead father's shoes. You're a
square man, and my mare is lost through no fault of yours, my lad.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Encouraged by these generous words, Basil told his story
straight, and Old Corrie listened with a pleasant face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The mare's gone,&quot; said Old Corrie when Basil had done, &quot;and
bad luck go with her. I know the brands on her: mayhap I shall come across her
one of these fine days. Describe the rascals to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil did as well as he could, and said Old Corrie was not
treating him as he deserved.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am treating you as an honest gentleman,&quot; said Old Corrie,
&quot;as I know you to be. Jem the Hatter the villain's called, is he? When a man
once gets a nickname on the goldfields it sticks to him through thick and thin;
if we meet he shall remember it. I give you a receipt in full, Master Basil.&quot;
And the good fellow held out his two hands, which Basil shook heartily. &quot;I was
sure something serious kept you away.&quot; With Basil's hand clasped firmly in his,
he gazed steadily into the young man's face. &quot;It is on odd fancy I've got,&quot; he
said, &quot;but it's come across me two or three times while we've been talking. Is
there any relationship between you and your new mate?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sure of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you met for the first time on Gum Flat?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For the first time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, it is odd, and the more I look at you now the odder it
becomes. You've let your hair grow since you went away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Obliged to,&quot; said Basil, laughing. &quot;I had no razor. There are
a couple I can claim in Mr. Bidaud's house, as well as a brush or two; but I
daresay I shall not get them now that Mr. Gilbert Bidaud is in possession. What
is your odd fancy, Corrie?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why that you and your new mate would be as like each other as
two peas, if you were dressed alike and trimmed your hair alike. Haven't you
noticed it yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've noticed that we resemble each other somewhat,&quot; said
Basil, &quot;but not to the extent you mention. I remember now he spoke of it
himself; and that is one reason perhaps why he took a liking to me, and nursed
me as he did. But I am terribly anxious to hear about the plantation and
Annette. What is going to happen there that she is to leave it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In my own way, Master Basil,&quot; said Old Corrie, brushing his
hand across his eyes to chase the fancy away, &quot;and to commence at the beginning.
When you left me in the wood I was splitting slabs, a job I was doing for poor
Mr. Anthony Bidaud. You doubted whether his brother would hold to it, as there
was no written bond to show for it, and you were right. I went up to the house,
as I said I would, and saw Mr. Gilbert. You described him well, Master Basil;
he's a man I would be sorry to trust. I told him of the contract between me and
his brother. 'Where is it?' he asked. 'There was none written,' I answered; 'it
was an order given as a dozen others have been, and of course you'll abide by
it.' 'Of course I will not,' said he. 'Who are you that I should take your word?
And you would fix your own price for the slabs? Clever, Mr. Corrie. Clever, Mr.
Corrie!' I had told him my name. 'But I am a cleverer and a sharper.' A sharper
he is in the right meaning of it, but he is not English, and didn't exactly know
what he was calling himself. 'No, no,' he said, 'the moment a man's dead the
vultures come. You are one. But I am equal to you. Burn your slabs.' 'You're a
pretty specimen,' I said. 'Your brother was a gentleman; it doesn't run in the
family.' He's a strange man, Master Basil, and if he ever loses his temper he
takes care not to show it. More than what I've told you passed between us, and
once he said quite coolly that if I could summon his brother as a witness, he
was willing to abide by his testimony. The testimony of a dead man! And to speak
so lightly of one's flesh and blood! I wouldn't trust such a man out of my
sight.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you see his sister?&quot; asked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did, but she said very little, and never spoke without
looking at Mr. Gilbert for a cue. He gave it her always in a silent way that
passed my comprehension, but they understand each other by signs.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And Annette--did you see her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, but at a distance. They kept her from me, I think, but I
saw her looking at me quite mournfully, and I felt like going boldly up to her,
but second thoughts were best, and I kept away, only giving her to understand as
well as I could without speaking that I was her friend, ready at any time to do
her a service. 'Well,' said I to Mr. Gilbert, 'my compliments to you. Your
throwing over the contract your brother made won't hurt me a bit; I could buy up
a dozen like you'--which was brag, Master Basil, and he knew it was--'but I
should be sorry to dishonour the dead as you are doing.' He took out a
snuff-box, helped himself to a pinch, smiled, and said, 'Sentiment, Mr. Corrie,
sentiment. I treat the dead as I treat the living. Rid me of you.' It was his
foreign way of bidding me pack, but I told him I should take my time, that I had
plenty of friends among his brother's workmen, and that I should go away very
slowly. 'And let me give you a piece of advice,' I said. 'If you or any agent of
yours comes spying near my hut I'll mark him so that he shall remember it.' 'Ah,
ah,' he said, still smiling in my face, 'threats eh?' 'Yes, threats,' said I,
'and as many more of 'em as I choose to give tongue to.' 'Foolish Mr. Corrie,
foolish Mr. Corrie,' he said, taking more snuff, 'to lose your temper. Let <i>me</i>
give <i>you</i> a piece of advice. Think first, speak afterwards. It is a
lesson--take it to heart. You are too impulsive, Mr. Corrie, like another person
who also trespasses here, one who calls himself Basil.' 'Mr. Basil is a friend
of mine,' I said, 'say one word against him, and I'll knock you down.' He was
frightened, though he didn't show it, and he beckoned to a man, who came and
stood by him. You know him, I daresay, Master Basil; his name is Rocke.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is my enemy, I am afraid,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I found that out afterwards; he has been spreading reports
about you either out of his own spite, or employed by cold-blooded Mr. Gilbert
Bidaud. So Rocke came and stood by his side, but not too willingly. We've met
before Rocke and me, and he knows the strength of my muscle. I smiled at him,
and he grinned at me, and I said, 'We were speaking of Master Basil, and I was
saying that if anyone said a word against him I was ready to knock him down.
Perhaps you'd like to say something.' 'Not at all,' said Rocke, and his grin
changed to a scowl, 'I know when it will pay me best to hold my tongue.' Mr.
Gilbert Bidaud shook with laughter. 'Good Rocke,' he said, 'wise Rocke. We'll
make a judge of you. Anything more to say?' This was to me and I answered,
almost as cool now as he was himself, 'Only this. You spit upon a dead man's
bond, and you are a scoundrel. Don't come near my hut, you or anyone that sides
with you.' Rocke understood this. 'But,' said I, 'any friend of Master Basil's
is heartily welcome, and I'll give them the best I have. So good day to you, Mr.
Gilbert Bidaud.' Then I went among the workmen and chatted with them, and picked
up scraps of information, and turned the current wherever I saw it was setting
against you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My hearty thanks for the service, Corrie,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're as heartily welcome. If one friend don't stick up for
another behind his back we might as well be tigers. You see, Master Basil,
you're a stranger here compared with me; I've been chumming with the men this
many a year, and never had a word with one except Rocke, and even he has some
sort of respect for me. Then you're a gentleman; I'm not. My lad, there are
signs that can't be hidden; you've got the hallmark on you. Well, when I'd done
as much as I could in a friendly way, I turned my back on the plantation, and
came back here, and went on with my splitting, as if the contract still held
good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was not that a waste of time, Corrie?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I took my own view of it. There was the dead man soon to be
in his grave; here was I with the blood running free through my veins. If he'd
been alive he'd have kept his word; I was alive, and I'd keep mine. So I
finished the contract out of respect for Mr. Anthony Bidaud, and there the slabs
are, stacked and ready. While I was at work my thoughts were on you; four days
passed, and you hadn't returned. I concluded that something had happened to you,
but that you'd appear some time or another, and all I could do was to hope that
you'd come back before I left the place. I had a great wish to see the little
lady, but I didn't know how to compass it. Compassed it was, however, without my
moving in it. Just a week it was after you'd gone that I was at work in the
wood; it was afternoon, a good many hours from sundown, when my laughing jackass
began to laugh outrageous. When we're alone together he behaves soberly and
decently, contented with quietly laughing and chuckling to himself, and it's
only when something out of the way occurs that he gives himself airs. He's the
vainest of the vain, Master Basil, and he does it to show off. His tantrums made
me look round, and there, standing looking at me and the laughing jackass,
without a morsel of fear of me or the bird, was the little lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Annette?&quot; cried Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The little lady herself,&quot; said Old Corrie.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_15" href="#div1Ref_15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was she alone?&quot; asked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, quite alone. I dropped my axe, told the jackass to shut
up--which it didn't, Master Basil--and took the hand she held out to me. Such a
little hand, Master Basil! I give you my word that as I held it in mine my
thoughts went back, more years than I care to count, to the time when I was a
little 'un myself, snuggling close up to my mother's apron. I can't remember
when I'd thought of those days last. They were stowed away in a coffin, and
dropped into a grave which stood between me as a boy and me as a man. It's like
having lived two lives, one of which was dead and buried. Now, all at once, the
dead past came to life, and said, in a manner of speaking, 'I belong to you,'
and it didn't seem unnatural. The touch of the little lady's hand was like a
magic wand, and if she had said to me, 'Let's have a game of hopscotch,' I
believe I should have done it and thought it the proper thing to do. But she
said nothing of the sort, only looked at me with melancholy sweetness, and hoped
I was not sorry to see her. Sorry! I was heartily and thankfully glad, and I
told her so, and the tears came into her pretty eyes, and I said, without
thinking at the moment that she'd lost a dear father, 'Don't cry, don't cry!
there's nothing to cry for;' but I set myself right directly by saying, 'I mean,
I hope it isn't me that makes you cry.' 'No,' she answered, 'it's only that you
speak so kind.' My blood boiled up, for those words of hers showed me that since
her father's death she had not been treated with kindness, and if she hadn't
been a little lady, rich in her own right, I should have offered to run off with
her there and then. But under any circumstances that would have been a dangerous
thing to do, for her and me; it would have brought her uncle down upon me, and
he'd have had the law on his side. So, instead of offering to do a thing so
foolish, I said, 'Did you come on purpose to see me?' 'Yes,' she answered, on
purpose. 'I gave them the slip, and they don't know where I am.' 'Don't you be
afraid then, my little maid,' I said, 'they won't find you here, because they
won't venture within half a mile of me. You've done no harm in coming to see a
friend, as you may be sure I am. Can I do anything for you?' 'Yes,' she said;
'you like Basil, don't you?' Upon that I said I was as true a friend of yours as
I was of hers. 'Will you tell me, please,' she said then, 'why he has gone quite
away without trying to see me? I know it wouldn't be easy, because my uncle and
aunt are against him; but I thought he would have tried. I have been to every
one of his favourite places, in the hope of meeting him, and my uncle has said
such hard things of him that my heart is fit to break.' Poor little lady! She
could hardly speak for her tears. Well, now, that laughing jackass was making
such a chatter, and behaving so outrageous, pretending to sob, which made her
sob the more, that I proposed to take her to my hut here, where we could talk
quietly. She put her little hand in mine and walked along with me to my hut, and
the minute we came in the magpie cried out, 'Little lady, little lady.' She
looked up at this, and I told her it was a magpie I was training for her. It
gave her greater pleasure than such a little thing as that ought to have done,
and though she did not say it in so many words I saw in her face the grateful
thought that she still had friends in the world that had grown so sad and
lonely. Then I told her all about your last meeting with me--how tenderly you
had spoken of her, what love you had for her, and how I had lent you my mare to
take you to a place where you hoped to find a doctor and a lawyer who might be
able to serve her in some way. The news comforted her, but she was greatly
distressed by the fear that you had met with an accident which prevented your
return. I wouldn't listen to this for the little maid's sake, and said I was
positive you would soon be back, and that nothing was farther from your mind
than the idea of going away entirely without seeing her again. 'He will have to
make haste,' said the little lady, with a world of thought in her face, 'or he
will never be able to find me.' I asked why, and she answered that she believed,
when everything was settled, that her uncle would sell the plantation and take
her away to Europe. 'Can't it be prevented?' she asked, and I said I was afraid
it could not; that her uncle stood now in the place of her father, and could do
as he liked. 'If you are compelled to go,' I said, 'you shall take the magpie
away with you to remind you of the old place--that is, if you will be allowed to
keep it.' 'I shall be,' she said; and now, child as she was, I noticed in her
signs of a resolute will I hadn't given her credit for. 'If you give it to me,
it will be mine, and they shall not take it from me. I will fight for it,
indeed, I will.' I was pleased to hear her speak like that; it showed that she
had spirit which would be of use to her when she was a woman grown. She stopped
with me as long as she dared, and before she went away she said she would come
again, and asked me if I thought I could teach the bird to speak your name. 'It
would be easy enough,' I answered, and that is how it comes about that the
magpie--which for cleverness and common-sense, Master Basil, I would match
against the cunningest bird that ever was hatched--can call out 'Basil--Basil,'
as clearly as you pronounce your own name. It was at that meeting, and at every
meeting afterwards, she gave me a message to you if you returned. You were to be
sure not to go away again without seeing her; if you couldn't contrive it, she
would; that proved her spirit again; and that if it should unfortunately happen
that you returned after she was taken away you were never to forget that Annette
loved you, and would love you all her life, whatever part of the world she might
be in. Those are her words as near as I can remember them, and they're easy
enough for you to understand, but it isn't so easy to make you understand the
voice in which she spoke them. I declare, Master Basil, it runs through me now,
broken by little sobs, with her pretty hands clasping and unclasping themselves
and her tender body shaking like a reed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dear little Annette,&quot; said Basil, and his eyes, too, were
tearful, and his voice broken a little; &quot;dear little Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She's worth a man's thoughts, Master Basil,&quot; said Old Corrie,
&quot;and a man's pity, and will be better worth em' when she's a woman grown. You're
a fortunate man, child as she is, to have won a love like the little lady's, for
if I'm a judge of human nature, and I believe myself to be--which isn't exactly
conceit on my part, mind you--it's love that will last and never be forgotten.
It's no light thing, Master Basil, love like that; when it comes to a man he'll
hold on to it if he's got a grain of sense in him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You cannot say one word in praise of Annette,&quot; said Basil,
&quot;that I'm not ready to cap with a dozen. I believe, with you, that she has a
soul of constancy, and I hold her in my heart as I would a beloved sister. If I
could only help and advise her! But how can I do that when she is to be taken
away to a distant land?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's no telling what may happen in the future,&quot; said Old
Corrie. &quot;What to-day seems impossible to-morrow comes to pass. To beat one's
head against a stone wall because things aren't as we wish them to be is the
height of foolishness, but it's my opinion that going on steadily doing one's
duty, working manfully and doing what's right and square, is the best and surest
way to open out the road we'd like to tread. Your new mate, Mr. Chaytor, hasn't
disturbed us, and I must do him the justice to say that he shows sense and
discretion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is one in a thousand,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and it is impossible
for me to express to you how sorry I am that you have not taken kindly to each
other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It does happen sometimes, but not often, that men are
mistaken in their likings and dislikings, but we'll not argue the point. Now
I've got to tell you how things stand at the plantation. There was an inquest on
the body of Mr. Anthony Bidaud, doctors and lawyers being called in by Mr.
Gilbert, and the verdict was that he died of natural causes. There being no
will, Mr. Gilbert took legal possession, as guardian to his niece under age. He
decides that it will not be good for her to remain where she is; but must be
educated as a lady, and brought up as one. That, says Mr. Gilbert, can't be done
on the plantation; it must be done in a civilized country. Consequently the
plantation must be sold. With lawyers paid to push things on, three months' work
had been done in three weeks. A purchaser has been found, deeds drawn up, money
paid, and next Monday they're off; Mr. Gilbert Bidaud, his sister, name unknown,
and the little lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hot haste, indeed,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To which neither you nor I can have anything to say legally.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is so, unhappily. And then to Europe?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And then to Europe. I am telling you what the little lady
tells me. I can't go beyond that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course not. But does she not know to what part of Europe?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She knows nothing more. He keeps his mouth shut; you can't
compel him to open it. There are cases, Master Basil, in which honesty is no
match for roguery; this is one. Mr. Gilbert Bidaud has the law on his side, and
can laugh openly at you. Now, the little lady was here yesterday. 'No news of
Basil?' she asked. 'No news of Basil,' I said. 'Is he dead, do you think?' she
whispered, with a face like snow. 'No,' I said stoutly; 'don't you go on
imagining things of that sort. He's alive, and will give a satisfactory account
of himself when he comes back.' I spoke confidently to keep up her heart, though
I had misgivings of you. 'I shall be here to-morrow,' she said, 'and every day
till we leave the plantation.' She has contrived cleverly, hasn't she, to slip
them as she does?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then I shall see her soon!&quot; said Basil, eagerly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In less than an hour, if she comes at her usual time. Our
confab is over. You had best go and seek your mate. I'll make my apologies to
him, if he needs 'em, for keeping you so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">If Basil had known, he had not far to go to find Newman
Chaytor, for that worthy was quite close to him. Being of an inquiring mind
Chaytor had resolved to hear all that passed between Basil and Old Corrie, and
had found a secure hiding-place in the rear, and well within earshot, of the two
friends. He stored it all up, being blessed with an exceptionally retentive
memory. Old Corrie went one way, and Basil went another, and Chaytor emerged
from his hiding-place. &quot;I am quite curious about little Annette,&quot; he said to
himself, as he followed Basil at a safe distance. &quot;Quite a sentimental little
body--and an heiress, too! Well, we shall see. Say that my friend Basil's future
is a nut--I'll crack it; I may find a sweet kernel inside.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He came up to Basil, and greeted him with a frank smile.
&quot;We've been talking about the plantation,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and poor Anthony
Bidaud's daughter, Annette. She is coming this afternoon to see me. I'll tell
you everything by-and-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't want to intrude upon your private affairs, Basil,&quot;
said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have a right to know,&quot; said Basil. &quot;I have no secrets
from you, Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then they talked of other matters, Chaytor with animation,
Basil with a mind occupied by thoughts of Annette. &quot;I see,&quot; said Chaytor,
patting Basil's shoulder with false kindness, &quot;that you are thinking of the
little maid. Now I'm not going to play the churl. Don't mind me for the rest of
the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're a good fellow,&quot; said Basil, as Chaytor walked away;
but he did not walk far. Unobserved by Basil, he kept secret watch upon him,
determined to see Annette, determined to hear what she and Basil had to say to
each other. As Old Corrie had said, &quot;there are cases in which honesty is no
match for roguery.&quot; Basil posted himself in such a position that he could see
any person who came towards the wood from Bidaud's plantation. He heard the thud
of Old Corrie's axe in the forest; the honest woodman could have remained idle
had he chosen, but he was unhappy unless he was at work, and though he desired
no profit from it he felled and split trees for the pleasure of the thing. Now
and again there came to Basil's ears the piping and chattering of
gorgeous-coloured birds as they fluttered hither and thither, busy on their own
concerns, love-making, nest-mending, and the like; in their commonwealth many
touches of human passion and sentiment found a reflex. Vanity was there,
jealousy was there, hectoring and bullying of the weak was there, and much sly
pilfering went on; entertainments, too, were being given, for at some distance
from the three men in the woods, one swinging his axe with a will and wiping his
cheerful brows, another with his heart in his eyes watching for a little figure
in the distance, and the third, stirred by none but evil thoughts, watching with
cunning eyes the watcher--at some distance from these two honest men and one
rogue were assembled some couple of dozen feathered songsters in green and
yellow coats. They perched upon convenient boughs and branches, forming a
circle, with invisible music books before them, and at a given signal from their
leader they began to pipe their songs without words, and filled space with
melody. Their music may be likened to the faintly sweet echoes of skilled
bell-ringers, each tiny bird the master of a note which was never piped unless
in harmony. It was while these fairy bells were pealing their sweetest chord
that Basil saw Annette approaching. He ran towards her eagerly, and called her
name; and she with a sudden flush in her face and with her heart palpitating
with joy, cried, &quot;Basil! Basil!&quot; and fell into his arms.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_16" href="#div1Ref_16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">He led her to a secluded spot, followed secretly by fox
Chaytor. They passed close to where Old Corrie was working, and he, hearing
footsteps--be sure, however, that Chaytor's were noiseless--laid down his axe,
and went towards them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has come--he has come!&quot; cried Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What did I tell you?&quot; said Old Corrie. &quot;All you've got to do
in this world, little lady, is to have patience.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She was so overjoyed, having tight hold of Basil's hand, that
she would have accepted the wildest theories without question.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Corrie,&quot; she said, &quot;may I have the magpie to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Surely,&quot; he replied, &quot;it is quite ready for you, and you will
be able to teach it anything you please. But why so soon? Aren't you coming
again?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her face became sad, and she clutched Basil's fingers
convulsively: &quot;I am afraid not this is the last, last time! I have heard
something, Mr. Corrie, and if it is true my uncle and aunt are going to take me
away to-morrow morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In that case,&quot; said Old Corrie, &quot;I will have the bird ready
for you. Now you and Master Basil can talk; I'll not interrupt you.&quot; He went
away at once, and left them together. For a little while they had nothing of a
coherent nature to say to each other; but then Basil, recognising the necessity
of introducing some kind of system into their conversation, related to Annette
all that had happened within his knowledge since the sad morning of her father's
death, and heard from her lips all that she had to relate. Much of it he had
already heard from Old Corrie. The refrain she harped upon was, &quot;And must we,
must we part, Basil? And shall we never, never see each other again?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Part we must, dear Annette,&quot; he said; &quot;I have no control over
you, and no authority that can in any way be established. When I first came to
the plantation I was a stranger to you and your father, and the law would
acknowledge me as no better now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Next to my dear father and mother,&quot; said Annette, &quot;I love you
best in all the world. They cannot take that away from me; what I feel is my
own, my very own. Oh, Basil, I sometimes have wicked thoughts, and feel myself
turning bad; I never felt so before my uncle came.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Annette, listen to me. You must struggle against these
thoughts and must say to yourself, 'They will make my dear father and mother
sorrowful. They have shown me kindness and love and I will show the same to
them.' You cannot see them, Annette, but their spirits are watching over you;
and there is a just and merciful God in heaven who is watching over you, too,
and whom you must not offend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do as you say, Basil, dear; I will never, never forget
your words. They will keep me good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let them keep you brave as well, my dear. I promise to
remember you always, to love you always, and perhaps when you are a woman--it
will not be so long, Annette--we shall meet again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, Basil, that will be true happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Time flies quickly, Annette. It seems but yesterday since I
was a boy myself, and when I look back and think of my own dear parents, I am
happy in the belief that I never did anything to cause them sorrow.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You could not, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, my dear, I don't know that; but I had a good mother and
so had you, and my father and yours were both noble men. They are not with us,
and that makes the duty we owe them all the stronger. To do what is right
because we feel that it is right to do it, not because it is done in the sight
of others--that is what makes us good, Annette. My mother taught me that lesson
as she lay on her death bed, and it has brought me great happiness; it has
supported me in adversity. You must not mind my speaking so seriously,
Annette----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I love to hear you, Basil. I will be like you, indeed I will.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Much better, I hope. You see, my dear, this is the last time
we shall be together for a long time; but not so long after all, if we look at
it in the right light, and I should like you to remember me as you would
remember a brother, who, being older than you, is perhaps a little wiser.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, Basil. All my wicked thoughts are gone; they shall
never come again; but I shall still feel a little unhappy sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course you will, dear, and so shall I. But faith in God's
goodness and the performance of our duty will always lighten that unhappiness.
The stars of heaven are not brighter than the stars of hope and love we can keep
shining in our hearts.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Kiss me, Basil; that is the seal. I shall go away happier
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell me, Annette. Are your uncle and aunt kind to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are neither kind nor unkind. They talk a great deal to
each other, but very seldom to me, unless it is to order me to do something.
Aunt says, 'Go to bed,' and I go to bed; 'It is time to get up,' and I get up?
'Come to dinner,' and I come to dinner. It is all like that; they never speak to
me as my father and mother did, and they have never kissed me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must be obedient to them, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will be, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are your guardians, and a great deal depends upon them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I know that; but I don't think they like me, and, Basil,
I don't think uncle is a good man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will be better,&quot; said Basil gravely, &quot;not to fancy that.
It may be only that he is a little different from other men, and that you are
not accustomed to his ways.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will try,&quot; said Annette piteously, &quot;to obey you in
everything, but I can't help my thoughts, and I can't help seeing and hearing.
He speaks in a hard voice to everybody; he is unkind to animals; he has never
put a flower on my dear father's grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There, there, Annette--don't cry. I only want you to make the
best, and not the worst, of things.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, Basil--indeed, indeed I will. When I am far away from
you, you <i>will</i> think, will you not, that I am trying hard to do everything
to please you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I promise to think so, and I have every faith in you. It is
all for your good, you know, Annette. When you are out of this country where are
your aunt and uncle going to live.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In Europe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But in what part of Europe?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't know. All that uncle and aunt say is, 'We are going
to Europe.' 'But in what country?' I asked. 'Don't be inquisitive,' they
answered; 'we are going to Europe;' and they will say nothing more. I am
sometimes afraid to speak when they are near me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Poor little Annette! Now attend to me, dear. Wherever you are
you can write to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Basil, yes. And may I? Oh, how good you are! Oh, if ever
I should get a letter from you! It will be the next best thing to having you
with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Remember what I am saying, Annette. I want you to write to
me, wherever you are, and I want to answer your letters. This is the way it can
be done. When you are settled write me your first letter--I shall not mind how
long it is----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be a long, long one, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And address it to 'Mr. Basil Whittingham, Post-office,
Sydney, New South Wales.' I shall be sure to get it. Now for my answer. If you
are happy in your uncle's house, and tell me so, I will send my answer there;
but if you think it will be best for me not to send it to his house, I will
address it to the post-office in whatever town or city you may be living. Some
friend in the new country (you are sure to make friends, my dear) will tell you
how you may get my letters. This looks a little like deceit, but it will be
pardonable deceit if you are unhappy--not otherwise. Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perfectly, Basil. I shall have something to think of now; you
have given me something to do. And will you ever come to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is my hope; I intend to work hard here to get money, and
if I am fortunate, in a few years, when you are a beautiful woman----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would like to be, Basil, for your sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will come to wherever you may be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not wish for anything more, Basil. I shall pray night
and morning for your good fortune. How happy you have made me--how happy--how
happy! I shall keep the stars of love and hope shining in my heart--for you. How
beautifully the bellbirds are singing. I shall hear them when I am thousands of
miles away. But, Basil, you will want something to remember me by.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, dear Annette, I need nothing to remind me of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do, Basil, and I have brought it for you. Look, Basil, my
locket----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But Annette----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have I said 'No' to anything you have told me--and will you
say 'No' to this little thing? I think it will not be right if you do; so, dear
Brother Basil, you must not refuse me. I wish I had something better to give
you, but you will be satisfied with this, will you not? I have worn it always
round my neck, since I was a little, little girl, and you must wear it round
yours. Promise me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I promise, dear, if you will not be denied.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not, indeed I will not--and your promise is made. See,
Basil, here it lies open in my hand; take it. The picture is a portrait of my
dear mother; father had it painted for me by a gentleman who came once to the
plantation. Then when you come to me in the country across the sea, you will
show it to me and tell me that you have worn it always and always, because you
love me, and because I love you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have nothing to give you, Annette. I am very, very poor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have given me a star of hope, Basil. How sorry I am that
you are poor! But my nurse, who has been sent away----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have they done that, Annette?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, and she cried so at leaving me. She told me that one day
I should be very, very rich. So what does it matter if you are poor? Let me
fasten it round your neck. Now you have me and my dear mother next your heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He took the innocent child in his arms, and she lay nestling
there a few moments with bright thoughts of the happy future in her mind.
Suddenly a loud &quot;Coo-ey&quot; was heard and the sound of hurried footsteps. It was
Old Corrie's voice that gave the alarm. It was intended as such, for when Basil
started to his feet and stood with his arm round Annette, holding her close to
him, he looked up, and saw Gilbert Bidaud standing before him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_17" href="#div1Ref_17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">A malicious smile played about the old man's lips as he
glanced at Basil and Annette. For a few moments he did not speak, but stood
enjoying the situation, feeling himself master of it; and when he broke the
silence his voice was smooth and suave. The malignancy of his feelings was to be
found in his words, not in the tone in which he uttered them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, Mr. Basil Whittingham once more? Mr. Basil Whittingham,
the English gentleman, ready at a moment's notice to give lessons in manners,
conduct, and good breeding. But then it is to proclaim oneself a fool to take a
man at his own estimate of himself. I find you here in the company of my niece.
Favour me with an explanation, Mr. Basil Whittingham.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is nothing to explain,&quot; said Basil, still with his arm
round Annette. &quot;I have been absent some time, and happening, fortunately, to
return before Miss Bidaud left the country, have met her here, and was
exchanging a few words of farewell.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course, of course. Who would venture to dispute with so
reproachless a gentleman? Who would venture to whisper that in these last few
words of farewell there was any attempt to work upon a child's feelings, and to
make the spurious metal of self-interest shine like purest gold? On one side a
young girl, as yet a mere child, whose feelings are easily worked upon; on the
other side a grown man versed in the cunning of the world, and using it with a
keen eye to profitable use in the future. Not quite an equal match, it appears
to me, but I may be no judge. If I were to hint that this meeting between you
and my dear niece and ward has anything of a clandestine nature in it, you would
probably treat me to a display of indignant fireworks. If I were to hint that,
instead of so advising this child that she should hold out her arms gladly to
the new life into which she is about to enter, you were instilling into her a
feeling of repugnance against it, and of mistrust against those whose duty it
will be to guide her aright and teach her--principles&quot;--his eyes twinkled with
malignant humour as he spoke this word--&quot;you, English gentleman that you are,
would repudiate the insinuation with lofty scorn. But when you exchange
confidences with me you are in the presence of a man who has also seen something
of the world, and who, although it has dealt him hard buffets, retains some
old-fashioned notions of honour and manliness. I apply the test to you,
adventurer, and you become instantly exposed. Ah! here is my sister, this sweet
young child's aunt, who will relieve you of your burden.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He took the hand of the unresisting girl and led her to her
aunt, whose arm glided round Annette's waist, holding it as in a vice.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not answer you,&quot; said Basil, with an encouraging smile
at Annette, whose face instantly brightened. &quot;Annette knows I have spoken the
truth, and that is enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Basil,&quot; said Annette, boldly, &quot;you have spoken the
truth, and I will never, never forget what you have said to me to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take her away,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud to his sister; &quot;the farce
is played out. In a week it will be forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-bye, Basil,&quot; said Annette &quot;and God bless you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-bye, Annette,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and God guard you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How touching, how touching!&quot; murmured Gilbert Bidaud. &quot;It is
surely a scene from an old comedy. Take her away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Just one moment, please,&quot; said Old Corrie, joining the group.
&quot;Here is something that belongs to the little lady, that she would like to take
with her to the new world. It will remind her of the old, and of friends she
leaves in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was the magpie in its wicker cage, whose tongue being
loosened by company, or perhaps by a desire to show off its accomplishments to
an appreciative audience, became volubly communicative.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil! Basil! Basil and Annette! Little lady! Little lady!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In his heart Gilbert Bidaud was disposed to strangle the bird,
but his smile was amiability itself as he said to Annette, &quot;Yours, my child?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, mine,&quot; she answered. &quot;Mr. Corrie gave it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But Mr. Corrie is not rich,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, pulling out
his purse; &quot;you are. Shall we not pay him for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Annette, before Old Corrie could speak. &quot;I would
not care for it if he took money for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well said, little lady,&quot; said Old Corrie; &quot;the bird is
friendship's offering, and for that will be valued and well cared for, I don't
doubt. It is your property, mind, and no one has a right to meddle with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Friendship's offering!&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, with a long,
quiet laugh. &quot;We came out to the bush to learn something, did we not, sister?
Why, here we find the finest of human virtues and sentiments, the smuggest of
moralities, the essence of refined feeling. It is really refreshing. Do not be
afraid, Mr. Corrie. Although I would not take your word about that
wood-splitting contract, I have some respect for you, as a rough specimen of
bush life and manners. We part friends, I hope.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not a bit of it,&quot; said Old Corrie. &quot;If ladies were not
present I'd open my mind to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank heaven,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, raising his eyes with
mock devotion, &quot;for the restraining influence of the gentler sex. You do not
diminish my esteem for you. I know rough honesty when I meet with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You shift about,&quot; interrupted Old Corrie, &quot;like a treacherous
wind. I'm rough honesty now, am I? You're the kind of man that can turn white
into black. Let us make things equal by another sort of bargain. I've given
little lady the bird. You'll not take it from her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Heavens?&quot; cried Gilbert Bidaud, clasping his hands. &quot;What do
you think of me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's not an answer. You'll not take it from her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not. Keep it, my child, and be happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you hear, little lady? Let us be thankful for small
mercies. Shake hands, my dear. When you're a woman grown, don't forget Old
Corrie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I never will--I never will,&quot; sobbed Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And don't forget,&quot; said Old Corrie, laying his hand on
Basil's shoulder, &quot;that Master Basil here is a gentleman to be honoured and
loved, a man to be proud of, a man to treasure in your heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will never forget it,&quot; said Annette; with a fond look at
Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And this, I think,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, with genial smiles
all round, &quot;is the end of an act. Let the curtain fall to slow music.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But it was not destined so to fall. As Annette's aunt turned
to leave with her niece, her eyes, dwelling scornfully on Basil for a moment,
caught sight of the chain attached to the locket which Annette had put round his
neck. Quick as lightning she put her hand to the child's neck, and discovered
the loss.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has stolen Annette's locket!&quot; she cried, pointing to the
chain.</p>

<p class="normal">As quick in his movements as his sister, Gilbert Bidaud
stretched forth his hand and tore the locket and chain from Basil's neck. It was
done so swiftly and suddenly that Basil was unable to prevent it; but the hot
blood rushed into his face as he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were you a younger man I would give you cause to remember
your violence. Annette, speak the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I gave it to you, Basil,&quot; said Annette, slipping from her
aunt's grasp, and putting her hand on Gilbert Bidaud's. &quot;It is false to say he
stole it. It belonged to me, and I could do what I pleased with it. I gave it to
Basil, and he did not want to take it at first, but I made him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She strove to wrench it from her uncle's hand, but it was easy
for him to keep it from her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will have it!&quot; cried Annette. &quot;I will, I will! It is
Basil's, and you have no right to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A storm in a teapot,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, who seldom lost
his self-possession for longer than a moment, &quot;Sister, you should apologise to
the young gentleman. Take the precious gift.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But instead of handing it to Basil he threw it over the young
man's head, and Newman Chaytor, who during the whole of this scene had been
skulking, unseen, in the rear, and had heard every word of the conversation,
caught it before it fell, and slunk off with it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall find it, Annette,&quot; said Basil. &quot;Good-bye, once more.
May your life be bright and happy!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Those were the last words, and being uttered at the moment
Newman Chaytor caught the locket and was slinking off, were heard and treasured
by him.</p>

<p class="normal">The whole of that day Basil, assisted by Old Corrie and
Chaytor, searched for the locket, of course unsuccessfully. He was in great
distress at the loss; it seemed to be ominous of misfortune.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_18" href="#div1Ref_18">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">The story of the lives of Basil and Chaytor during the ensuing
three years may be briefly summarised. So far as obtaining more than sufficient
gold for the bare necessaries of life were concerned, ill-luck pursued them.
They went from goldfield to goldfield, and followed every new rush they heard
of, and were never successful in striking a rich claim. It was all the more
tantalising because they were within a few feet of great fortune at least
half-a-dozen times. On one goldfield they marked out ground, close to a claim of
fabulous richness, every bucket of wash-dirt that was hauled from the gutter
being heavily weighted with gold. This was the prospectors' claim, and the shaft
next to it struck the gutter to the tune of twelve ounces a day per man. The
same with the second, and Basil and Chaytor had every reason, therefore, to
congratulate themselves, especially when the men working in the claim beyond
them also struck the lead, and struck it rich. But when at length the two gold
diggers in whom we are chiefly interested came upon the gutter, they were
dismayed to find that instead of ten ounces to the tub, it was as much as they
could do to wash out ten grains. It was the only poor claim along the whole of
the gutter; on each side of them the diggers were coining money, and they were
literally beggars. It is frequently so on the goldfields, the life on which very
much resembles a lottery, riches next door to poverty; but the hope of turning
up a lucky number seldom dies out in the heart of the miner. He growls a bit,
apostrophises his hard luck in strong language, is despondent for a day, and the
next shakes off his despondent fit, and buckles to again with a will, going
perhaps to another new rush, jubilant and full of hope, to meet again with the
same bad fortune. The romance of the goldfield is a rich vein for novelists,
some few of whom have tapped it successfully; but the theme is far from being
worn out, and presents as tempting material to-day as it did years ago, when
gold was first discovered in Australia.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is maddening, Basil,&quot; said Chaytor, as he gazed gloomily
at the &quot;prospect&quot; in his tin dish--two or three specks which would not have
covered a pin's head. &quot;Here we are upon the gutter again, and the stuff will
wash about half a pennyweight to the tub.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's jolly hard,&quot; said Basil, proceeding to fill his pipe
with cut cavendish, &quot;but what can we do? Grin and bear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, you're philosophical, you are,&quot; growled Chaytor, &quot;but I'm
not so easy minded. Just think of it, and bring a little spirit to bear upon it,
will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Off you go,&quot; said Basil. &quot;I'm listening.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here we are on Dead Man's Flat, and here we've been these
last three weeks. Just four days and three weeks ago we struck our claim in
Mountain Maid Gully, having got two ounces and three pennyweights for our
month's hard work. That contemptible parcel of gold brought us in barely eight
pounds, the gold buyer pretending to blow away sand before he put it in the
scale, but blowing away more than two pennyweights of the stuff, and reducing it
to a little over two ounces. We weighed it in our own gold scales before we took
it to him, and it was two ounces three pennyweights full weight. You can't deny
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've no intention of denying it. Don't be irritable. Go on,
and let off steam; it will do you good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I want to point out this thing particularly,&quot; fumed Chaytor,
&quot;so that we can get to the rights of our ill luck, get to the bottom of it, I
mean, and find out the why and the wherefore. Eight pounds we receive for our
gold, when we should have received eight pounds ten; not a sixpence less; but
the world is full of thieves. Now, that eight pounds gives us a little under
twenty shillings a week a man. I would sooner starve.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wouldn't--though I've had bitter blows, Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not worse than I have.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the pinching of our own shoes we feel, old fellow.
We're a selfish lot of brutes. Thank you for pulling me up. I'm sorry for you,
Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I'm sorry for you. Thinking our claim worthless we leave
Mountain Maid Gully, and come here to Dead Man's Flat. We are ready to jump out
of our skins with joy, for we come just in time--so we think. Here's a new lead
struck, with big nuggets in it, and we mark out our claim exactly one hundred
and twenty feet from the prospector's ground. They get one day twenty ounces,
the next day twenty-eight, the next day forty-two--a fortune, if it lasts.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which it seldom does.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It often does, and even if it lasts only six or seven weeks
it brings in a lot. 'We're in luck this time,' I say to you, and I dream of
nuggets as big as my head. The gutter, we reckon, is forty feet down, and we
reach it in three weeks. Everybody round us is making his pile--why shouldn't
we? But before we strike the lead a digger comes up, and says, 'Hallo, mates,
have you heard about the claim you left in Mountain Maid Gully?' 'No,' say we,
'what about it?'--'Oh,' says the digger, 'only that two new chums jumped in
after you'd gone away and found out it was the richest claim on the goldfield.
They took a thousand ounces out of it the second week they were at work.' What
do you say to that, Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Jolly hard luck, Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Cursed hard luck, I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Strong words won't better it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They're a relief. You take it philosophically, I admit; I
growl over it like a bear with a sore head. I'd like to know why there's this
difference between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll try and tell you presently, when you've finished about
the two claims.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right. I shouldn't be much of a man if the news about the
ground we ran away from didn't rile me. I was so wild I could hardly sleep that
night. But when I heard that in the next claim to the one we're working now a
nugget weighing a hundred and fifty ounces was found I thought perhaps we'd got
a richer claim than the one we'd deserted. So I bottled up my bad temper, and
went on working with a good grace. And now we're on the gutter again, and here's
the result.&quot; He held out the tin dish, and gazed at the tiny specks of gold with
disgust. &quot;Why it's the very worst we've struck yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not quite that. We've had as bad. What shall we do? Stick to
it, or try somewhere else?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We daren't go away. Stick to it we must. If we left it and I
heard afterwards the same sort of story we were told about our claim on Mountain
Maid, I should do somebody a mischief. You agree with me, then, that we remain
and work the claim out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I agree to anything you wish, Chaytor. I will stay or go
away, just as you decide.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor looked at him with an eye of curiosity. &quot;Were you ever
a fellow of much strength of character, Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think so, once; not in any remarkable degree, but
sufficient for most purposes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And now,&quot; replied Basil, taking his pipe from his mouth, and
holding it listlessly between his fingers, &quot;the life seems to have gone out of
me. The only tie that binds me to it is you. I owe you an everlasting debt of
gratitude, old fellow, and I wish I could do something to repay it. But in tying
yourself to me you are tied to a log that keeps dragging you down. The ill luck
that pursues us come from me. Throw me off and fortune will smile upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And upon you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No. The taste of all that's sweet and beautiful has gone out
of my mouth; I'm a soured man inside of me; you're a thousand times better than
I am. What is bitterness in you comes uppermost; it pleases you to hide the best
part of you; but you cannot hide it from me, for I've had experience of you and
know you. Now I'm the exact reverse. Outwardly you would think I'm an
easy-going, easy-natured fellow, willing always to make the best of things, and
to look on the brightest side. It is untrue; I am a living hypocrite. Inwardly I
revile the world; because of my own disappointments I can see no good in it.
Good fortune or bad fortune, what does it matter to me now? It cannot restore my
faith, it cannot destroy the shroud which hangs over my heart. That is the
difference between us. You are a thoroughly good fellow, I am a thoroughly bad
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was not always the same with you. How have you become
soured?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thorough experience. Look here, Chaytor, it is only right you
should be able to read me. You have bared your heart to me, and it is unfair
that I should keep mine closed. There have been times when business of your own
has called you to Sydney. We were never rich enough to go together, so you had
to go alone, while I remained, in order not to lose the particular luckless
claim we happened to be working in, and out of which we were always going to
make our fortune. On the occasions of your visits you have executed a small
commission for me, entailing but little trouble, but upon the successful result
of which I set great store. It was merely to call at the Post-Office, and ask
for letters for Basil Whittingham. The answer was always the same: there were
none. Every time you returned and said, 'No letters for you, Basil,' I suffered
more than I can express. There was less light in the world, my heart grew old. I
believe I did not betray myself; at all events, I took pains not to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I never knew till now, Basil,&quot; said Chaytor falsely, and in a
tone of false pity, &quot;that you thought anything at all of not receiving letters.
You certainly succeeded in making me believe that it did not matter one way or
another.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is what I have grown into, a living hypocrite, as I have
said. Why should I inflict my troubles upon you? You have enough of your own,
and I have never been free from the reproach that evil fortune attends you
because you persist in remaining attached to me. But the honest truth is, I
suffered much, and each time the answer was given there was an added pang to
make my sufferings greater. I'll tell you how it is with me, or rather how it
was, for were you torn from me, were I pursuing my road of life alone, I should
feel like a ghost walking through the world, cut off from love, cut off from
sympathy. Not so many years ago--and yet it seems a lifetime--it was very
different. I know I loved my dear mother, and perhaps in a lesser degree, but
still with a full-hearted love, I loved my father. You know the whole story of
my life; I cannot recall an incident of any importance in my career in the old
country and in others through which I travelled which I have omitted to tell
you. Partly it was because you took so deep an interest in me, partly because it
gratified me to dwell upon matters which gave me pleasure. Yes, although my shot
was pretty well expended when I left England for Australia, there is nothing in
my history there which causes me regret. Until the death of my father everything
looked fair for me. It was a good world, a bright world, with joyous
possibilities in it, some of which might in the future be realised. I spent my
fortune in paying my father's debts, and though it alienated my uncle from me
and ruined my prospects, never for one moment did I regret it. There was no
merit due to me in doing what I did; any man of right feeling would have done
the same; you would have been one of the first to do it. Well, I came out to the
Colonies with a light heart and nearly empty pockets. I had my hardships--what
mattered? I was young, I was strong, I was hopeful, I believed in human
goodness. So I went on my way till I came to Anthony Bidaud's plantation. There
the sun burst forth in its most brilliant colours, and all my petty trials
melted away. Had my nature been soured, it would have been the same, I think,
for love is like the sun shining upon ice. I met a man and a friend in Anthony
Bidaud; we understood and esteemed each other. I met a little maid to whom my
heart went out--you know whom I mean, little Annette. You never saw her,
Chaytor. When she came to Old Corrie's hut on the day we left Gum Flat, after
you snatched me from a cruel death and nursed me to strength, you were wandering
in the woods, and did not join us till she had gone. If you had met her you
might have some idea of the feelings I entertained towards her, for although she
was but a child at the time, there was a peculiar attraction and sweetness about
her which could not have failed to make an impression upon you. You are
acquainted with all that passed between me and Annette's father, of the project
he entertained of making me guardian to his little daughter, and of his strange
and sudden death; and you are also acquainted with the unexpected appearance of
Gilbert Bidaud upon the scene, and what afterwards transpired, to the day upon
which he and his sister and Annette left the colony for Europe. The little maid
promised faithfully to write to me from Europe, and I gave her instructions,
which she could scarcely have forgotten, how to communicate with me. Her letters
were to be directed to the Sydney Post-office, and she was to let me know how to
communicate with her. Well, unreasonably or not, I fed upon the expectation of
these promised letters, but they never came. We must have some link of affection
to hold on to in this world if life is worth living, and this was the link to
which I clung. From old associations in England I was absolutely cut away, not
one friend was left to me; and when I arrived at Anthony Bidaud's plantation and
made Annette my friend, I felt as if all the sweetness of life dwelt in her
person. It was an exaggerated view perhaps, but so it was. Since that time three
years have passed, and she is as one dead to me, and I suppose I am as one dead
to her. For some little while after she left I used to indulge in hopes of
wealth, in hopes of striking a golden claim and becoming rich. Then I used to
say to myself, I will go home and wait till Annette is a woman, when I will take
her from the hateful influence of Gilbert Bidaud, and--and--but, upon my honour,
my thoughts got no farther than this; my dreams and hopes were unformed beyond
the point of proving myself her truest and best friend. But her silence has
changed my nature, and I no longer indulge in hopes and dreams, I no longer
desire riches. The future is a blank: there is no brightness in it. If it
happens that we are fortunate, that after all our ill luck we should strike a
rich claim, I will give you my share of the gold freely, for I should have no
use for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would not accept it, Basil,&quot; said Chaytor; &quot;we will share
and share alike. Have you no desire, then, to return to England?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall never go back,&quot; replied Basil. &quot;My days will be ended
in Australia.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where you will one day meet with a woman who will drive all
thoughts of Annette out of your head.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That can never be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You think of her still, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As she was, not as she is. I live upon the spirit of the
past.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He spoke not as a young man, but as one who had lived long
years of sad and bitter experiences. In this he was unconsciously doing himself
a great wrong, for his heart was as tender as ever, and in reality he had
intense faith in the goodness of human nature; but the theme upon which he had
been dilating always, when he reflected upon or spoke of it, filled his soul
with gloom, and so completely dominated him with its melancholy as to make him
unintentionally false to his true self.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The question is,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;whether it is worth while to
brood upon such a little matter. The heart of a child--what is it? A pulse with
about as much meaning in it as the heart of an animal. There is no sincerity in
it. I have no doubt you would be amazed if you were to know Annette as she is
now, almost a woman, moulded after her uncle's teaching, and therefore repulsive
in nature as he was. You are wise in your resolve to make no attempt to shatter
an ideal. I have suffered myself in love and friendship, and I know better than
you how little dependence is to be placed in woman. Let us get back to the
claim. We'll not give it up till we've proved it quite worthless.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_19" href="#div1Ref_19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Had Basil been acquainted with the extent of Newman Chaytor's
baseness and villainy he would have been confounded by the revelation. But
unhappily for himself he was in entire ignorance of it, and it was out of the
chivalry of his nature that he placed Chaytor on an eminence, in the way of
human goodness, to which few persons can lay claim. But Basil was a man who
formed ideals; it was a necessity of his existence, and it is such men who in
their course through life are the most deeply wounded.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor's visits to Sydney were not upon business of his own,
he had none to take him there; they were simply and solely made for the purpose
of obtaining the letters which arrived for Basil from England, and any also
which might arrive for himself; but these latter were of secondary importance.
In his enquiries at the Post-office he was always furnished with an order
signed, &quot;Basil Whittingham&quot; (of which he was the forger) to deliver to bearer
any letters in that name. Thus he was armed to meet a possible difficulty,
although it would have been easy enough to obtain Basil's letters without such
order. But as he had frequently observed he was a man who never threw away a
chance.</p>

<p class="normal">As a matter of fact, he received letters both for himself and
Basil, which he kept carefully concealed in an inner pocket. He had become a man
of method in the crooked paths he was pursuing, and these letters, before being
packed away, were placed in a wrapper, securely sealed, with written directions
outside to the effect that if anything happened to him and they fell into the
hands of another person they should be immediately burnt. This insured their
destruction in the event of their falling into the hands of Basil, for Chaytor
had implicit faith in his comrade's quixotism and chivalry, at which he laughed
in his sleeve.</p>

<p class="normal">It has already been stated that Chaytor had made himself a
master of the peculiarities of Basil's handwriting. Having served his
apprenticeship in his disgraceful career in England he could now produce an
imitation of Basil's hand so perfect as to deceive the most skilful of experts,
who often in genuine writing make mistakes which should, but do not, confound
them. Shortly after Annette and her uncle and aunt had taken their departure
from Australia he wrote to Basil's uncle in England. It is not necessary to
reproduce the letter; sufficient to say that it was chatty and agreeable, that
it recalled reminiscences which could not but be pleasant to the old gentleman,
that it abounded in affectionate allusions, and wound up with the expression of
a hope that Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham would live till he was a hundred in
health and happiness. There was not a word in the letter which could be
construed into the begging of a favour; it was all gratitude and affection; and
the writer asked whether there was any special thing in Australia which Mr.
Bartholomew Whittingham would like to have. &quot;Nothing would give me greater
pleasure,&quot; said the wily correspondent, &quot;than to obtain and send it to you in
memory of dear old times. I will hunt the emu for you; I will even send you home
a kangaroo. God bless you, my dear uncle! I have been a foolish fellow I know,
but what is done cannot be undone, and I have only myself to blame. There, I did
not intend to make the most distant allusion to anything in the past that has
offended you, but it slipped out, and I can only ask your forgiveness.&quot; In a
postscript the writer said that his address was the Post Office, Sydney, not, he
observed, that he expected Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham to write to him or answer
his letter, but there was no harm in mentioning it. It was just such a letter as
would delight an old gentleman who had in his heart of hearts a warm regard for
the young fellow whose conduct had displeased him. Chaytor had some real ability
in him, which, developed in a straight way, would have met with its reward; but
there are men who cannot walk the straight paths, and Chaytor was one of these.</p>

<p class="normal">Two months afterwards, before any answer could have reached
him, Chaytor wrote a second letter, as bright and chatty as the first, brimful
of anecdote and story, and this he despatched, curious as to the result of his
arrows. They hit the mark right in the bull's-eye, but Chaytor was not quite
aware of this. However, he was satisfied some time afterwards at receiving a
brief note from a firm of lawyers--not from Messrs. Rivington, Sons and
Rivington, to whom he had been articled, but from another firm, and for this he
was thankful--which said that Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham had received his
nephew's letter, and was glad to learn that he was in good health and spirits.
That was all, but it was enough for Chaytor. In the first place it proved that
his handwriting was perfect and the circumstances he spoke of correct. In the
second place it proved that Basil's uncle had a soft spot left for him and that
the writer had touched it. In the third place it proved that his letters were
welcome, and that others would be acceptable.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A good commencement,&quot; thought Chaytor. &quot;I have but to play my
cards boldly, and the old fool's forty thousand pounds will be mine. What a
slice of luck for me that Rivington, Sons, and Rivington no longer transact his
business! At a distance I could deceive them. At close quarters their suspicions
might be excited, although I would chance even that, if there were no other way.
I wonder how long the old miser will live. I am not anxious that he should die
yet; things are not ripe; there is Basil to get rid of.&quot; He was ready and
resolved for any desperate expedient to compass his ends, and he kept not only
the letters he received, but copies of the letters he sent, for future guidance,
if needed. Be sure that he continued to write, and that he made not the
slightest reference to any hope of becoming the old gentleman's heir, or of
being reinstated in his affection. It is strange how a man's intellect and
intelligence are sharpened when he is following a congenial occupation.
Machiavelli himself could not have excelled Newman Chaytor in the execution of
the villainous scheme he was bent upon carrying out. He became even a fine judge
of character, and not a word he wrote was malapropos. Let it be stated that,
despite the risk he was running, he derived genuine pleasure from the plot he
had devised. He thought himself, with justice, a very clever fellow; if all went
on in England as he hoped it would he had no fear as to being able to silence or
get rid of Basil on the Australian side of the world. He would be a dolt indeed
if he could not remove a man so weak and trustful as Basil from his path. He had
other letters from Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham's lawyers, and he knew, from a
growing cordiality in their tone (a sentiment in which lawyers never of their
own prompting indulge in their business transactions) that they were dictated by
the old gentleman himself. His interpretation of Basil's uncle not writing in
his own person was that he had made up his mind not to have any direct personal
communication with his nephew, and that being of an obstinate disposition, he
was not going to break his resolution. &quot;For all that,&quot; thought Chaytor, &quot;I will
have his money. I'll take an even bet that he has either not destroyed his old
will, or that he has made a new one, making Basil his heir. Newman Chaytor,
there are not many men who can beat you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He received other letters as well from other persons--from his
old mother, addressed to himself, and from Annette, addressed to Basil.
Certainly when he went to Sydney his hands were full, and he had enough to do.
He did not grudge the labour. He saw in the distance the pleasures of life
awaiting him, and it is a fact that in time he came to believe that they were
his to enjoy, and that Basil had no rightful claim to them. It was he, Newman
Chaytor, who had schemed for them, who was working for them. What was Basil
doing? Nothing. Standing idly by, without making an effort to come into his own.
&quot;This is the way men get on,&quot; said Chaytor to himself, surveying with pride the
letter he had just finished to Basil's uncle, &quot;and I mean to get on. Why, the
trouble of writing this letter alone is worth a thousand pounds. And what is the
risk worth, I should like to know? I am earning double the money I shall get.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The letters of his old mother to himself were less
frequent--not more than one every nine or ten months. They always commenced, &quot;My
dearly beloved son,&quot; and they plunged at once into a description of the
difficulties with which she and her poor husband were battling. Her first letter
gave him a piece of news which caused him great joy. It informed him that a
certain bill which Chaytor had left behind him, dishonoured, had been bought by
his father, at the sacrifice of some of the doubtful securities which he had
saved from the wreck of his fortune. &quot;You can come home with safety now, my dear
son,&quot; wrote the unhappy old woman. &quot;Well, that is a good hearing,&quot; mused Newman
Chaytor; &quot;I was always afraid of that bill; it might have turned up against me
at any moment, but now it is disposed of, and I am safe. So, the old man still
had something left worth money all the time he was preaching poverty to me. Such
duplicity is disgusting. He owes me a lot for frightening me out of the country
as he did. And here is the old woman going on with the preaching about hard
times and poverty. Such selfishness is wicked, upon my soul it is.&quot; It was true
that his mother's letters ran principally on the same theme. They had not a
penny; they lived in one room; their rent was behindhand; her husband was more
feeble than ever; they often went without food, for both she and he were
determined to starve rather than appeal to the parish. Could not her dear son
send them a trifle, if it was only a few shillings, to help them fight the
battle which was drawing to its close? She hoped he would forgive her for asking
him, but times were so hard, and the winter was very severe. They had had no
fire for two days, and the landlady said if they could not pay the last two
weeks' rent that they would have to turn out. &quot;Try, my dear boy, try, for the
sake of the mother who bore you, and who would sell her heart's blood for you,
if there was a market for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">These letters annoyed Chaytor, and he thought it horribly hard
that his mother should write them. &quot;It is a try on,&quot; he thought; &quot;the old man
has put her up to it. I ought to know the ins and outs of such transparent
tricks. 'Now, write this,' says the old man; 'Now write that. We must manage to
screw something out of him: work upon his feelings, mother.' That's the way it
goes. I'll bet anything they've got a smoking dinner on the table all the time,
but Newman's at a distance, and can't see it. Oh, no, I can't see anything; a
baby might impose upon me.&quot; He never thought of the night he saw his mother
begging in the roadway with a box of matches in her hands. Some men are gifted
with the power of shutting out inconvenient memories, as there are others who
never lose sight of a kindness they have received or of a debt that is justly
due. Long before this the reader has discovered to which class Chaytor belonged.</p>

<p class="normal">Nevertheless he replied to the letters, cantingly regretting
that he was unable to send his dear old mother the smallest remittance to help
her on in her struggles. &quot;How is it possible,&quot; he wrote, &quot;when I am myself
starving? It is months since I have had to work sixteen hours a day breaking
stones on the road for a piece of dry bread. The hardships I have endured, and
am still enduring, are frightful. This is a horrible place for a gentleman to
live in. I should not have been here if father had not driven me away. It almost
drives me mad to think that if he had not been so hard to me, if he had allowed
me to stop at home and manage his affairs, I could have pulled them straight,
and that we should all of us be living now in comfort and plenty in the only
country in the world where a man can enjoy his days. You have no idea what kind
of place this colony is. Men die like lambs in the snow, and the sufferings they
endure are shocking to contemplate. I do not suppose I shall live to write you
another letter, but if you can manage to send me a few pounds it may arrive just
in time to save me.&quot; And so on, and so on. He took a keen delight in the
duplicities he was practising, and he would read his letters over with a feeling
of pride and exultation in his cleverness. &quot;How many men are there in the
world,&quot; he would ask himself, &quot;who could write such a letter as this? Not many.
Upon my word I'm wasted in this hole and corner. But there's by-and-by to come;
when I get hold of that forty thousand pounds I'll have my revenge. No galley
slave ever worked harder than I am working for a future I mean to enjoy.&quot; That
may have been true enough, but the work of a galley slave was honest labour in
comparison with that to which Newman Chaytor was bending all his energies.</p>

<p class="normal">Lastly, there were the letters Annette wrote to Basil. They
arrived at intervals of about four months, so that Chaytor was in possession of
seven or eight of them. Proceeding as they did from a pure and beautiful nature,
these letters, had Basil received them, would have been like wine to him, would
have comforted and strengthened him through the hardest misfortunes and
troubles, would have kept the sun shining upon him in the midst of the bitterest
storms. He would have continued to work with gladness and hope instead of with
indifference. It would have made the future a bright goal to which his eyes
would ever have been turned with joy. Evidences of kindness and sympathy, still
more, evidences of unselfish affection and love, are like the dew to the flower.
They keep the heart fresh, they keep its windows ever open to the light. But of
this blessing Basil was robbed by the machinations of a scoundrel: hence there
was no sweetness in his labour, no hope for him in the future. So much to heart
did Basil take Annette's silence that, had his nature been inclined to evil
instead of good, mischief to others would probably have ensued, but as it was he
was the only sufferer. In his utterances, when he was drawn to speak of the
shock he had received, he was apt to exaggerate matters and to present himself
in the worst light, but there had fallen to his share an inheritance of moral
goodness which rendered it impossible for him to become a backslider from the
paths of rectitude and honour. Except that he was unhappy in himself, and that
Annette's silence took the salt out of his days, he was as he ever was,
straightforward in his dealings and gentle and charitable towards his
fellow-creatures.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear, dear Basil&quot; (thus ran Annette's first letter,
written about five months after their last meeting in the Australian woods), &quot;I
have tried ever so hard to write to you before, but have not been able to
because of uncle and aunt. I was afraid if they found out I was writing to you
that they would take the letter away or do something to prevent it reaching you,
and I wanted, too, to tell you how you could write to me, but have never been
able till now. You will be glad to hear that if you write and address your
letters exactly as I tell you, I am almost sure of receiving them. But first I
must say something about myself and how I am. Uncle and aunt are not unkind to
me, but they are not kind. They leave me to myself a good deal, but I know I am
being watched all the time. I don't mind that so much, but what I do miss is my
dear father's voice and yours, and the birds and flowers and beautiful scenery I
always lived among till I was taken away. I would not mind if you were with me,
for I love you truly, dear Basil, and can never, never forget you. That last
time we were together by Mr. Corrie's hut, how often and often do I think of it!
I go through everything that passed except the unkind words spoken by Uncle
Gilbert, which I try not to remember. I must have a wonderful memory, for
everything you said to me is as fresh now as though you had just spoken them.
Yes, indeed. Perhaps it is because when we were on board ship I used to sit on
the deck, with my face turned to Australia--the captain always pointed out the
exact direction--and go through it all in my mind over and over and over again,
till I got letter perfect. Shall I prove to you that it is really so? Well,
then, when I told you I was afraid I was turning hard and had since Uncle
Gilbert came to the plantation--the dear old plantation!--you chided me so
gently and beautifully, and I promised never to forget your words, knowing they
would keep me good. Then you said, 'Let them keep you brave as well, my dear. I
promise to remember you always, to love you always, and perhaps when you are a
woman--it will not be so long, Annette--we shall meet again.' Well, Basil dear,
I am waiting for that time. I know it will not be yet, perhaps not for years,
but I can wait patiently, and I shall always bear your words in mind. 'The stars
of heaven are not brighter than the stars of hope and love we can keep shining
in our hearts.' Do you remember, Basil? And then I asked you to kiss me, and
said that was the seal and that I should go away happier. It comes to my mind
sometimes that your words are like flowers that never die, and that grow sweeter
and more beautiful every day. You could not have given me anything better to
make me happy. But I must not keep going on like this or I shall not have time
to tell you some things you ought to know.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, then, Basil dear, we are not settled anywhere, and if
you were to come home now (you call it home, I know, and so will I) you would
not know where to find me unless you went to a place I will tell you of
presently. First we came to London and stopped there a little while, then we
went to Paris, then to Switzerland, and now we have come back to London, where
we shall remain two or three weeks, and then go somewhere else, I don't know
where. Uncle Gilbert never tells me till the day before, when he says, 'We are
going away to-morrow morning; be ready.' So that by the time you receive this
letter we shall be I don't know where. Uncle Gilbert is very fond of theatres,
but he has not taken me to one because he says they are not proper places for
girls. I daresay he is right, and I don't know that I want to go, but aunt has
been very dissatisfied about it, as she is as fond of theatres as Uncle Gilbert
is. He used to go by himself, and aunt would stop with me to take care of me,
but a little while ago, a day or two before we came back to London, they had a
quarrel about it. They did not notice that I was in the room when they begun,
and when they found it out they stopped. But I think it is because of the
quarrel that when we were in London a young woman was engaged to travel with us
and to look after me when uncle and aunt are away. I am very glad for a good
many reasons. I am not very happy when they are with me, and I breath more
freely--or perhaps I think I do--when they are gone. The young woman they have
engaged is kind and good-natured, and I have grown fond of her already, and she
has grown fond of me, so we get along nicely together. Her name is Emily
Crawford, and she has a mother who lives in Bournemouth, a place by the sea
somewhere in England. Her mother is a poor woman, and that is why Emily is
obliged to go to service, but she is not a common person, not at all, and she
has a good heart. She can read and write very well, and she picks up things
quicker than I can. Of course you want to know why I speak so much of Emily,
when I might be writing about myself. Well, it is very, very important, and it <i>
is</i> about myself I am speaking when I am speaking of her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil, dear, it does one good to have some one to talk to
quite freely and to open one's heart to. All the time I have been away, until
this week, I have not had any person who would listen to me or who cared to
speak of the happy years I spent on our dear plantation. Whenever I ventured to
say a word about the past Uncle Gilbert put a stop to it at once by saying,
'There is no occasion to speak of it, you are living another life now. Forget
it, and everybody connected with it.' Forget it! As if I could! But I do not
dare to disobey him. He is my guardian, and I must be obedient to him. Aunt is
just the same, only she snaps me up when I say anything that displeases her,
while uncle speaks softly, but he is as determined as she is although they do
speak so differently. I do not know which way I dislike most--I think both. So
one night this week when uncle and aunt were away, and I was reading, and Emily
was sewing, she said to me, 'You have come from Australia, haven't you, miss?'
Oh, how pleased I was! I answered yes, and then we got talking about Australia,
and I told her all about the plantation and the life we led there, and all sorts
of things came rushing into my mind, and when I had told her a great deal I
began to cry. It was then I found out Emily's goodness, for there she was by my
side wiping my tears away and almost crying with me, and that is how we have
become friends. After that I felt that I could speak freely to her, and I spoke
about you, of course. She promised not to say a word to uncle or aunt, and I
know I can trust her. Now, Basil, dear, she has told me how you can write to me
and how I can obtain your letters without uncle or aunt knowing anything about
it. Emily writes home to her mother and receives letters from her. If you will
write and address your letters to the care of Mrs. Crawford, 14, Lomax Road,
Bournemouth, England, Mrs. Crawford will enclose them to Emily, who will give
them to me. Mrs. Crawford will always know where Emily is while she remains with
me, which will be as long as she is allowed, Emily says, and I am sure to get
your letters. I feel quite happy when I think that you will write to me, telling
all about yourself. You said I was certain to make friends in the new country I
was going to, through whom we should be able to correspond, and although I would
sooner do it through uncle and aunt (but there is no possibility of that because
they do not like you), I feel there is nothing very wrong in our writing to each
other in the way Emily proposes. So that is all, and you will know what to do. I
can hardly restrain my impatience, but it is something very sweet to look
forward to.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope you found the locket with the portrait of my dear
mother in it. When we see each other I shall expect you to show it to me. If you
see Mr. Corrie tell him that the magpie is quite well, and that I can teach him
to say almost anything. Both uncle and aunt have grumbled a good deal about the
bird, and would like me to get rid of it, but that is the one thing--the only
thing--that I have gone against them in. 'I will be obedient in everything
else,' I said, 'but I must keep my bird. You promised me.' So they have yielded,
and I have my way in this at all events. It means a great deal to me because I
take care it shall not forget your name. I keep it in my own room, where they
see very little of it, and it is only when we are travelling that it is a
trouble to them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now I must leave off, Basil dear. With all my love, and
hoping with all my heart that we shall see each other when I am a little
older,--I remain; for ever and ever, your loving friend,</p>

<p style="text-indent:55%">&quot;<span class="sc">Annette</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">This letter interested and amused Newman Chaytor. &quot;She is a
clever little puss,&quot; he thought, &quot;and will not be hard to impose upon, for all
her cunning. I wonder, I wonder&quot;--but what it was he wondered at did not take
instant shape; it required some time to think out. He replied to the letter,
addressing Annette as she directed. Although he knew it was not likely that
Annette could be very familiar with Basil's handwriting, he was as careful in
imitating it as he was in his letters to Basil's uncle; and as in the case of
his letters to that old gentleman, he kept a copy of the letters he wrote to
Annette. He was very careful in the composition of his correspondence with the
young girl. He fell into the sentimental mood, and smiled to think that the
sentiments he expressed to Annette were just those which would occur to Basil if
he sat down to write to her. &quot;Basil would be proud of me,&quot; he said, &quot;if he read
this letter. It is really saving him a world of trouble, and he ought to be
grateful to me if it ever come to his knowledge--which it never shall. I will
see to that.&quot; During the first year of the progress of the vile plot the full
sense of the dangerous net he was weaving for himself did not occur to him, and
indeed it was only by degrees that he became keenly conscious of the peril
attending its discovery. It made him serious at first, but at the same time more
fixed in his resolve to carry it out to the bitter end. Whatever it was
necessary to do he would do ruthlessly. Everything must give way to secure his
own safety, to insure the life of ease and luxury he hoped to enjoy, if all went
well.</p>

<p class="normal">If all went well! What kind of sophistry must that man use
who, to compass his ends, deems all means justifiable, without considering the
misery he is ready to inflict upon others in the pursuit upon which he is
engaged? There lies upon some men's natures a crust of selfishness so cruel that
it becomes in their eyes a light matter to transgress all laws human and divine.
They are blinded by a moral obliquity, and think not of the hour when the veil
shall be torn from their eyes, and when the punishment which surely waits upon
crime is meted out to them.</p>

<p class="normal">Annette's first letter to Basil is a fair example of those
which followed, except that the progress of time seemed to deepen the attachment
she bore for him. In one letter she sent a photograph of herself, and Newman
Chaytor's heart beat high as he gazed upon it. Annette was growing into a very
lovely womanhood; beautiful, sweet, and gracious was her face; an angelic
tenderness dwelt in her eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And this is meant for Basil,&quot; said Chaytor, in his solitude:
and then exclaimed, as he contemplated the enchanting picture, &quot;No! For me--for
me!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_20" href="#div1Ref_20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">The claim they were working proved very little richer than
others they had taken up. They made certainly a few shillings a week more than
was absolutely necessary to keep them in food and tobacco, and these few
shillings were carefully husbanded by Chaytor, who was treasurer of the
partnership. Their departure was hastened by a meeting which did not afford
Chaytor unalloyed pleasure. As he and Basil sat at the door of their canvas tent
one summer night, who should stroll up to them but old Corrie.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here you are, then,&quot; cried the honest fellow.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, Corrie!&quot; exclaimed Basil, jumping to his feet, and
holding out his hands.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Master Basil,&quot; said Old Corrie, grasping them cordially, &quot;I
am more than glad to see you. I was passing through, and hearing your tent was
somewhere in this direction, I made up my mind to hunt you up. Well, well,
well!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here's my mate,&quot; said Basil, motioning to Chaytor, &quot;you
remember him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Old Corrie, nodding at Chaytor. &quot;So you've been
together all this time. What luck have you had?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bad luck,&quot; answered Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sorry to hear it. Never struck a rich patch, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;And you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can't complain. To tell you the truth, I've made my pile.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have!&quot; cried Chaytor, with a furious envy in his voice.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have. You made a mistake when you refused to go mates with
me; I could have shown you a trick or two. However, that's past: what's ended
can't be mended.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Haven't quite made up my mind. Think of going to Sydney for a
spree; perhaps to Melbourne for another; perhaps shall give up that idea, and
make tracks for old England. I've got enough to live upon if I like to take care
of it. Well, Master Basil, I wish you had better news to give me. Have you heard
from the old country? No?&quot; This was in response to Basil's shake of the head.
&quot;Why, I thought the little lady promised to write to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She did promise, but I have not heard for all that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Out of sight, out of mind,&quot; observed Chaytor, inwardly
discomposed at the turn the conversation had taken.</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie gave him a sour look. &quot;I'll not believe that of the
little lady. The most likely reason is that she has been prevented by that old
fox her uncle. Her silence must have grieved you, Master Basil.&quot; Basil nodded.
&quot;I know how your heart was set upon her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't let's talk about it,&quot; said Basil, &quot;it is the way of the
world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That may be,&quot; said Old Corrie, regarding Basil attentively,
&quot;but I'd have staked my life that it wasn't the way of the little lady. What has
come over you? You're changed. You were always brimming over with life and
spirits, and now you're as melancholy as a black crow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm falling into the sere and yellow,&quot; said Basil, with a
melancholy smile.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can only guess at what you mean. You're getting old. Why,
man alive, there's a good five-and-twenty year between you and me, and I don't
consider myself falling into the what-do-you-call-'em! Pluck up, Master Basil.
Here, let's have a little chat aside.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor gave Basil a look which meant, as plain as words could
speak it, &quot;Are you going to have secret conversations away from me after all the
years we have been together, after all I've done for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Corrie,&quot; said Basil, laying one hand on Old Corrie's arm and
the other on Chaytor's, &quot;if you've anything to say to me I should like you to
say it before Chaytor. There's nothing I would wish to hide from him. He's been
the truest friend to me a man ever had, and I owe him more than I can ever
repay.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nonsense, Basil,&quot; said Chaytor with magnanimous humility;
&quot;don't say anything about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But it ought to be said, and I should be the ungratefullest
fellow living if I ever missed an opportunity of acknowledging it. I owe you
something too, Corrie. There's that mare of yours I borrowed and lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shut up,&quot; growled Old Corrie, &quot;if you want us to part
friends. I've never given the mare a thought, and as for paying me for it, well,
you can't, and there's an end of it. I'll say before your mate what is in my
mind. You're a gentleman, Master Basil, and here you are wasting your time and
your years to no purpose. England is the proper place for you.&quot; Chaytor caught
his breath, and neither Basil nor Old Corrie could have interpreted this
exhibition of emotion aright; but Basil, who thought he understood it, smiled
gently at Chaytor, as much as to say, &quot;Don't fear, I am not going to desert
you.&quot; Old Corrie, who had paused, took up his words: &quot;England is the proper
place for you. Say the word, and we'll go together to Sydney and take two
passages for home. There you can hunt up your old friends, and you'll be a man
once more. Come now, say, 'Yes, Corrie,' and put me under an obligation to you
for life.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can't say yes, Corrie, but I'm truly obliged to you for
your kind offer. Even if I wished to break my connection with Chaytor--which I
don't--it's for him to put an end to our partnership, not for me--don't you see
that it would be impossible for me to lay myself under an obligation to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I don't see it,' growled Old Corrie.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then, again, Corrie, what inducement have I to return to
England?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's little lady,&quot; interrupted Old Corrie.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has forgotten me,&quot; said Basil, sadly. &quot;What business have
I to thrust myself upon her? If she desired to continue a friendship which was
as precious to me as my heart's blood--yes, I don't mind confessing it; there
may be weakness, but there is no shame in it--would she not have written to me?
She would, if it was only one line. It is true that her uncle may be jealously
guarding and watching her--there was love lost between us--but in these three
years that have passed since the last day we saw each other, it is not possible
to think that she could not have contrived once to have put in the post a bit of
paper with only the words, 'I have not forgotten you, Basil.' Who and what am I
that I should cross the road she is traversing for the purpose of bringing a
reminiscence to her mind that she chooses not to remember? There would not be
much manliness in that. Besides, it's a hundred chances to one that she's not in
England at all. It is my belief she is living in her father's native country,
Switzerland, where, surrounded by new scenes and new companions, I hope she is
happy. Thank you again, Corrie; I cannot accept your offer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right,&quot; said Corrie, with disappointment in his face and
voice; &quot;you ought to know your own mind, though I make bold to say I don't
believe you've said what's in your heart. Well, there's an end to it. I'm off
early in the morning. Good-bye, Master Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-bye, Corrie, and good luck to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good luck to <i>you</i>, better than you've had in more ways
than one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-bye, Mr. Corrie,&quot; said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie could scarcely refuse the hand that Chaytor held
out to him, but the grasp he gave it was very different from the grasp he gave
Basil's. Before he turned to leave the ill-assorted comrades he did something
which escaped the eyes of Basil, but not those of Chaytor. He furtively dropped,
quite close to Basil's feet, a round wooden matchbox, which, emptied of matches,
gold-diggers frequently used to fill with loose gold. Unobserved by old Corrie,
Chaytor put his foot on the box and slipped it to the rear of himself. This was
done while Old Corrie was turning to go. Basil was genuinely sorry to See the
last of his friend. Both the unexpected meeting and the leave-taking had a touch
of sadness in them which deeply affected him, and he gazed with regret after the
vanishing form of the man who had offered to serve him. This gave Chaytor an
opportunity of slyly picking up the matchbox; it was weighty, and Chaytor knew
that it was filled with gold. &quot;A bit of luck,&quot; he thought, as he put the box
into his pocket, &quot;and a narrow escape as well.&quot; He felt like a man sitting on a
mine which a stray match might fire at any moment.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil,&quot; he said, when Old Corrie was out of sight, &quot;we will
strike our tent to-morrow, and go prospecting. I have a likely spot in my mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very well,&quot; said Basil listlessly. &quot;How about money? Can we
manage to get along?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes, we can manage.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Early in the morning the pegs which fastened the tent were dug
out of the ground, the tent was rolled up and tied, and with heavy swags of
canvas, blankets, tools, and utensils conveniently disposed about their persons,
Basil and Chaytor set their faces to the south. They walked for two days,
camping out at night, and halted at length on the banks of a river, the waters
of which were low. In the winter the floods rolling down from the adjacent
ranges made the river a torrent, covering banks which were now bare. These banks
were of fine sand, and rising on each side for a distance of some thousands of
yards were shelving mountains studded with quartz. Some eighteen months ago
Basil and Chaytor had passed the place on their way to a new rush, and Chaytor
thought it a likely place in which to find gold. They were now quite alone, not
a living soul was within a dozen miles of them. They had reached the spot
secretly, and their movements were unknown to any but themselves. Their nearest
neighbours were on a cattle station some twelve or thirteen miles away.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have had an idea,&quot; said Chaytor, throwing the swag off his
shoulders, an example which Basil followed, &quot;for a long time past that somewhere
about here gold was to be found. My plan is to prospect the place well, without
any one being the wiser. Who knows? We may discover a new goldfield, and make
our fortunes before we are tracked. Let us camp here, and try. We can't do much
worse than we've done already.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm agreeable to anything you propose,&quot; said Basil. &quot;Let us
camp here by all means.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The great thing is, that nobody must be let into the secret.
If we are discovered, 'Rush, O!' will be the cry, and we shall be overrun before
we can say Jack Robinson.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have only to say what you wish, Chaytor. You have the
cleverer head of the two. I hope for your sake we shall be successful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You don't much care for your own.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You'll sing to another tune when we do succeed. It's
wonderful how the possession of a lot of money alters one's views.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll wait till I get it,&quot; said Basil, sagely.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The river runs low at this season and there's no reason in
the world why the sand banks shouldn't hold gold.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They will hold it if its there,&quot; said Basil, with a smile.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We'll try the banks first because they are the easiest, and
if we don't get gold in sufficient quantities there we'll try higher up the
range. It's studded with quartz, and it looks the right sort. We'll put our tent
up now, and in the morning we'll commence work--or rather you will commence
while I am away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where are you going to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's grub to look after. We can't do without meat and
flour. All we've got to live on at present is a tin of sardines, about half a
pint of brandy, a little tea, and a couple of handfuls of biscuits. Now, I call
that a coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In what respect?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you forget,&quot; said Chaytor reproachfully, &quot;the first night
you come to Gum Flat? I gave you then pretty well all I had in the world in the
shape of provisions, some biscuits, some sardines, and a flask of brandy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You did, old fellow, and that is the sum total of our
provisions this evening.&quot; He shook Chaytor's hand warmly. &quot;Don't think me
ungrateful, Chaytor, because I don't profess much. Old Corrie said I was
changed, and I suppose I must be; but I shall never be so changed as to be
unmindful of the way you've stuck to me. Yes, it is a coincidence. But go on.
What do you mean to do about grub, for I see you've something in your mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's only one thing to do,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;I must go to
the cattle station to-night, get there early in the morning, and buy mutton and
flour. I shall have to look out sharp that I'm not followed when I make my way
back again, but I think I can manage it. I've done more difficult jobs than
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you will be tramping the bush,&quot; said Basil, &quot;while I
remain at my ease here. Why can't I go instead of you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because,&quot; replied Chaytor, in a tone of affectionate
insistance, &quot;as you have already confessed, I am the cleverer of the two, and
because I have an idea, if we lose this chance, that we shall never get another.
I don't want you to be seen, Basil, that's the plain truth of the matter. You're
not up to the men we meet. Now, I am sly and cunning----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You?&quot; interrupted Basil. &quot;You are the soul of candour and
honesty, Chaytor. No one else should say that of you while I stood by.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't mean exactly what I said, Basil, but I am sure I can
do the job more neatly than you could. As to the tramp through the bush, I think
nothing of it, so let it be as I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil making no further objection, the tent was put up and a
trench dug around to carry the rain away. Then a camp fire was made, and the
water for tea boiled in a tin billy, after which they finished the biscuits and
sardines.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will have to hold out till I come back,&quot; said Chaytor.
&quot;As I need not start till past midnight, I'll turn in for an hour or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Shortly afterwards the comrades were wrapt in slumber, and the
man with the evil conscience slept the sounder of the two. A little after
midnight he rose and without disturbing Basil, started for the cattle station.
It was a warm starlit night, and he pondered upon matters as he made his way
through the bush. Indeed, during the past two days he had thought deeply of the
situation in which he was placed. Old Corrie's proposition to take Basil to
England had greatly alarmed him, and had opened his eyes more clearly to its
gravity. It was this which had caused him to hurry Basil away from the vicinity
of Old Corrie, for it was quite likely that Corrie would make another attempt to
prevail upon Basil before he took his departure, and the second time Basil might
yield. At all hazards this must be prevented; step by step he had descended the
abyss of crime, and it was too late for him now to turn back. In entering upon
an evil enterprise men seldom see the cost at which success must be purchased;
it is only when they are face to face with consequences that they tremble at
their own danger.</p>

<p class="normal">By daybreak Chaytor was at the cattle station and had made his
purchases; by noon he had rejoined Basil. His purchases, at the station had
attracted no attention; it was a common enough proceeding, and now they had food
for a week. Fifteen miles beyond the cattle station was a small township where
they could also obtain supplies; a pilgrimage once a week to station or township
would keep them going. In the township such gold as they obtained and wished to
dispose of could also be turned into money. Thus, although they were quite
alone, they were within hail of all that was necessary. Shortly after Chaytor's
return they set to work on the banks of the river. Basil showed his mate some
pieces of quartz with fair-sized specks of gold in them, but Chaytor decided to
try the river first, alluvial digging being so much easier. They found gold in
the sand, and sufficient to pay, but not sufficient to satisfy Chaytor's
cupidity. The result of a week's labour was between two and three ounces.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is better than we have done yet,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is only the washings from the hills,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;and
at any unexpected moment a flood of rain would swamp us. There are too many
trees about to please me; wood draws water from the clouds. If we don't do
better than this by the end of next week we'll mark out a claim on the range
yonder, where the blue slate peeps out of the quartz.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Another journey had to be made for food, and this time Chaytor
went to the township, where he obtained what he required and sold exactly seven
pennyweights of gold. He put on an appearance of great anxiety while the gold
was being weighed, and sighed when the weight was announced. This was to throw
the storekeeper off the scent; any considerable quantity of gold disposed of
proudly would have excited suspicion of a Tom Tiddler's ground somewhere near,
and Chaytor, had he so behaved, would certainly have been shadowed by men who
were ever watchful for signs of the discovery of a new goldfield. It was in
Chaytor's power to sell some fourteen ounces of gold had he been so inclined,
for the matchbox which Old Corrie had furtively dropped at Basil's feet, and
which Chaytor had slyly picked up unknown to his mate, contained twelve ounces
of the precious metal, but he knew better than to attempt it. There was a
post-office in the township, from which he dispatched a letter to the Sydney
office, requesting that any letters lying there for Basil Whittingham might be
forwarded on to him. He wrote and signed the order in Basil's name. He could not
very well go to Sydney at present to fetch them; there would be a risk in
leaving Basil so long alone, for there being no coaches running from the
township, the journey to Sydney and back could not be accomplished in less than
nine or ten days. Easier to obtain the letters from England, if any arrived, by
the means he adopted, and it was the easiest of tasks to keep the affair from
the knowledge of Basil, who never dreamed of asking at any post-office whether
there were any letters for him.</p>

<p class="normal">They worked a second week on the river-bank, at the end of
which they had washed out over three ounces.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An improvement,&quot; remarked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor shook his head discontentedly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let us mark off a prospector's claim up the hill,&quot; he said.
&quot;We can always come back to the river.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This was done, and they commenced to sink. The difficulty they
now encountered was the want of a windlass. Chaytor would not venture to
purchase one in the township, whither he went regularly, being well aware that
he could have done nothing that would more surely have drawn attention upon him.
At odd times he bought some pieces of rope which he and Basil spliced till they
had a length of about eighty feet. This rope, properly secured, enabled them to
ascend and descend the shaft, foot-holes in the sides assisting them. The labour
of digging a shaft in this manner was increased fourfold at least, but they
could not be too cautious, Chaytor said. He remarked also that they seemed to be
haunted by coincidences, and upon Basil asking for an explanation reproached him
for his bad memory.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How many of us were there upon Gum Flat,&quot; he said, &quot;after
your horse was stolen? Two. You and I alone. How many are there here? Two. You
and I alone. When you fell down the shaft how did I get you up? By means of a
rope secured at the top. How do we get up and down this shaft? By the same
means. There was no windlass there; there is no windlass here. Don't you call
these coincidences?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Basil, &quot;it is very singular.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would be very singular,&quot; thought Chaytor, &quot;if you were at
the bottom of this shaft one of these fine days and never got out of it alive.
In that case coincidence would not hold good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He drew a mental picture of the scene: Basil helpless below,
the rope lying loose on the top, and he sitting by it waiting to assure himself
that the mate by whom he had dealt so foully could never rise in evidence
against him. He saw this mental picture at the very moment that Basil, with his
sad earnest face, was in sight.</p>

<p class="normal">In the shaft they were sinking they were following a thin vein
of gold-bearing quartz which luckily for them was not devious in its bearings,
but ran down perpendicularly. It was very narrow, not more than an inch in
width, but the deeper they sank the richer it grew. The vein was more rubble
than stone, and the stuff was easily pounded and washed. The first week they
discovered it they obtained four ounces of gold, the second week seven, the
third week twelve, the fourth and fifth weeks the same, and then there was a
jump to twenty ounces. They had reached a depth of forty odd feet, and not a
living being but themselves had been seen near the spot.</p>

<p class="normal">This lucky break in their fortunes gave Chaytor serious and
discomforting food for thought. He was convinced that their better luck would
continue for some time, and was almost sure that the thin vein they were
following would lead them to a richer and wider reef. What would be the effect
of wealth upon Basil? Would it alter his views? Would it turn his thoughts
homewards? He became hot and cold when this last thought suggested itself, and
that night he was visited in his sleep by a dream so startling that he jumped up
in affright and sat in the dark trembling like a leaf in a strong wind. He
dreamt that Basil had discovered his treachery, and had torn open his secret
pocket in which he kept not only the letters from Annette and Basil's uncle he
had received from England, but the documents he had stolen from Basil on Gum
Flat, and the locket which Annette had given to Basil at their last meeting.
&quot;You monster!&quot; Basil had cried. &quot;You have ruined my life and shall pay the
penalty!&quot; It was at this point that Chaytor awoke, trembling and in great fear.
Presently, when the pulses of his heart beat more regularly, he heard Basil's
soft breathing. He struck a match, and rising, quietly looked down upon his
comrade. The young fellow was sleeping calmly, with no thought of the evil
genius standing over him. Convincing himself that his stolen treasures were
safe, Chaytor crept back to his stretcher, but he had little more sleep that
night. His sense of security was shaken; the earth was trembling beneath his
feet.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_21" href="#div1Ref_21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">When a man evilly inclined turns from the path of evil, it is
generally because he fears for his own safety. He does not choose the straight
road or relinquish a bad purpose from the awakening of the moral principle, but
from a conviction that the deviation will best serve his own interests. In the
initial stages of a bad scheme the prime mover seldom counts the cost; it is
only when he is deeply involved that the consequences of his evil-doing stare
him in the face, and warn him to halt. True repentance is rare; but there have
been instances where a man, suddenly appalled by the enormity of his career of
crime, conscientiously resolves to turn before it is too late, and to expiate,
as far as lies in his power, for his misdeeds. There is something of heroism in
this, and the sinner may hope for forgiveness at the divine throne, if not from
human hands. Of such heroism Newman Chaytor was not capable. If he wavered, it
was purely from selfish reasons, and because he saw before him a path in which
lay greater chances of safety for himself. That he did waver is true, and the
more wholesome and more merciful course which suggested itself to him was due,
not to conscientious motives, but to circumstances quite independent of his
original design. On the day following his disturbing dream he and Basil struck a
wonderfully rich patch in the claim they were working. The stuff which was
raised to the surface was literally studded with gold, and by nightfall they had
washed out fifty ounces. The excitements of a gold-digger's life when fortune
smiles upon him are all-absorbing. Marvellous possibilities dazzle and distort
his mind; delirious visions rise to his imagination. In the early days of the
goldfields it was a belief with numbers of miners that, at some time or other,
gold would be discovered in such quantities that it could be hewn out like coal.
A favourite phrase was, &quot;We shall be able to cut it out with a cold chisel.&quot; Of
course every man hoped that this wonderful thing would happen to him. He held a
chance in the lottery, and why should <i>he</i> not draw the grand prize which
would astonish the world?</p>

<p class="normal">These possibilities flitted through Chaytor's mind as he and
Basil sat at the door of their tent, smoking their pipes after their day's
labour. The chairs they sat on were stumps of trees. Furniture they had none,
inside their tent or out of it. For their beds they had gathered quantities of
dry leaves, over which they spread a blanket, with another to roll themselves
in. Rough living, but healthier than life in civilised cities. Early to bed and
early to rise, plain food, moderate drinking, exercising their muscles for a
dozen hours a day--all this was conducive to a healthy physical state. Their
faces were embrowned, their limbs were hardened, their beards had grown
long--they looked like men. This may be said of Chaytor as well as of Basil, for
such play of expression as would have revealed the cunning of his nature was
hidden by his abundant hair. A stranger, observing them, would have been
astonished at the likeness of one to the other, and could have formed no other
conclusion than that they were twin-born; but no stranger had seen them thus,
for it was only during their late seclusion that Chaytor, had copied Basil so
exactly. Basil took but little note of this resemblance, and if he referred to
it at all it was in a manner so slight as to show that he attached no importance
to it. But it was seldom absent from Chaytor's mind; he had brooded constantly
upon it, and had studied it as a lesson which, perfectly answered, was to bring
with it the rich reward for which he had schemed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A good day's work,&quot; said Basil, holding out his hand for the
tin dish which Chaytor held.</p>

<p class="normal">This tin dish contained the gold which they had gathered since
sunrise, and Chaytor was turning it over with his knife. The moisture had dried
out of it, and the gold lay loose. Chaytor passed the dish to Basil, who, in his
turn, played with the shining metal with somewhat more than usual interest.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nearly as much,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;as we've got these last five
weeks. It is a rare good day's work--if only it will last.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's the question,&quot; said Basil; &quot;I should like to weigh
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They entered the tent, and weighed the gold in the gold
scales, which form part of a miner's working implements. It turned the fifty
ounces.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Honestly paid for,&quot; said Basil, &quot;it represents a couple of
hundred pounds. A hundred pounds each.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor merely nodded, and made no comment upon the remark,
but it dwelt in his mind. Not so very long ago Basil had expressed indifference
regarding their possessions of gold, and had gone the length of saying that
Chaytor might have his share, for all he cared for it. Now he expressed an
interest in it, and reckoned their day's work at &quot;a hundred pounds each.&quot; That
indicated that he looked upon half as his fair share. What did this
newly-awakened interest portend? With his instinctive cunning Chaytor felt that
this was not a favourable time to open up the subject; far better to let it work
quietly until it came to a natural head. Besides, he was feverishly engrossed in
the question he had suggested, whether the rich patch they had struck would
last. Time alone could answer that question. They retired to their beds of dry
leaves a little earlier than usual, and were at work in the morning with the
rising of the sun. Basil worked chiefly at the bottom of the shaft, Chaytor at
the top, and the honest man of this ill-assorted pair sent up two buckets of
stuff before breakfast, which was even richer than they had raised on the
previous day. Basil climbed to earth's surface hand over hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He uses the rope like a cat,&quot; thought Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">The two buckets of stuff were emptied into a tub.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let us wash it out before breakfast,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">They went down to the river, carrying the tub between them. On
the top of the auriferous soil were two tin basins, and, after puddling the tub
well and letting the worthless refuse flow over the brim, they set to work
washing what remained in the basins, with that rotary motion in which
gold-diggers are so skilful, and which enables them to get rid of the loosened
earth, and keep the heavy precious metal at a safe angle in the bottom of the
dish. It had hitherto been Basil's practice to leave this delicate operation to
Chaytor, but on this morning he took part in it, using one dish, while Chaytor
used the other. Chaytor took, note of every small circumstance; nothing escaped
him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is a new move of yours, Basil,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am beginning to take a real interest in the work,&quot; admitted
Basil. &quot;In a manner of speaking, it is waking me up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Glad to hear it,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;These two buckets are worth
something. There's not less than twenty ounces.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">There was more; the stuff they had washed yielded twenty-three
ounces, and the whole day's yield was worth four hundred pounds.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing to complain of now, Chaytor,&quot; observed Basil in the
evening.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing.&quot; Basil was busy with paper and pencil. &quot;What are you
up to there? Figuring?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Basil. &quot;I am reckoning how much four hundred
pounds a day would bring us in at the end of the year. Here it is. Three hundred
and twelve working days in the year, leaving Sundays free.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why should we do that?&quot; asked Chaytor. &quot;There's no one to see
us. It would be a sheer waste of so much money.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil looked up in surprise; the remark was not agreeable to
him, the tone in which it was spoken was still less so.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am old-fashioned perhaps,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not choose to
work on the Sabbath day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Growing particular.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; I have always held the same notion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We'll not argue. What is your reckoning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Three hundred and twelve working days a year,&quot; continued
Basil. &quot;Twelve days for sickness, leaving three hundred. At four hundreds pound
a day we get a total of a hundred and twenty thousand--in pounds. Sixty thousand
pounds each. Truly, a great fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If it lasts,&quot; again said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course, if it lasts. There's the chance of its getting
better. How does it look to you--as if it will hold out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor had been down the claim for some hours during the day,
and had pocketed between forty and fifty ounces, which he chose to regard as his
own special treasure trove.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's no saying,&quot; he said. &quot;The vein runs sideways into the
rock. It may peg out at any moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We shall not have done badly by the time it does. I have to
thank you for bringing me here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Chaytor, ungraciously; &quot;it was my discovery. Don't
forget that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall never forget it, Chaytor, nor any of the other good
turns you have done me. I don't know whether it is a healthy or an unhealthy
sign that this better luck should have aroused me from the apathy in which I
have been so long plunged. It has softened me; the crust of indifference, of
disbelief in human goodness, is melting away, I am glad to say. That this is due
to the prospect of becoming rich is not very creditable; I would rather that the
change in me had sprung from a less worldly cause; it would have made me better
satisfied with myself. But we mortals are very much of the earth, earthy, and we
take too readily the impressions of immediate circumstances and of our
surroundings. They mould our characters, as it were, and change them for better
or worse.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can do a lot of thinking in a little time, Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How so, Chaytor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because yesterday you were black, to-day you are white.
Yesterday it was a bad world; to-day it is a good one. A rapid transformation,
savouring somewhat of fickleness.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A just reproof, but I cannot alter my nature. I have never
given myself credit for much stability except in my affections, and there, I
think, I am constant. As you say, a little reflection has effected a great
change in me. We judge the world too much from our own stand-point. We are
fortunate, we trust and are not deceived, we love and are loved in return, our
daily labour is rewarded--it is a good world, a bright world. We are
unfortunate, we trust and are deceived, we love and are not loved in return, we
toil and reap dead leaves--it is a bad world, a black world. That is the way
with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All of which wise philosophy has sprung from our discovery of
a rich patch of gold.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am afraid I can ascribe these better and juster feelings to
no other cause.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil,&quot; said Chaytor, toying with his pipe and tobacco, &quot;say
that your reckoning should be justified by results. Say that we work here
undiscovered for a year--for there is the contingency of our being tracked to be
thought of----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Say that we do not fall ill or meet with an accident which
disables us, say that to-day is but a sample of all the other days to follow in
the next twelve months, say that we make a hundred thousand pounds, what would
you do with your share? For I suppose,&quot; said Chaytor, with a light laugh, &quot;that
the offer you once made of letting me keep the lot if we struck gold rich, is
now withdrawn.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am properly reproved. Yes, Chaytor, I should expect my
share.&quot; Basil said this in a rather shamefaced voice. &quot;It proves in the first
place that I am not a very dependable fellow, and in the second place it proves
my philosophy, that we are moulded by immediate circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, it is natural enough; I never expected to meet with a man
who would step out of the ordinary grooves. There are temptations which it is
impossible to resist, and you and I are no different from the rest of mankind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should place you above the majority, Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am obliged to you, but I am as modest as yourself, and
cannot accept the distinction. Well, Basil, say that everything happened as I
have described, what would you do at the end of the year, with its wonderful
result of overflowing purses?&quot; Basil was silent and Chaytor continued: &quot;You said
once that you intended to live and die in the colonies. Do you stick to that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What would you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should return to England.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor shivered. This good fortune, then, which he had
bestowed upon Basil, was to be the means of his own destruction. Basil in
England, nothing could prevent his treachery being discovered. He had led to his
own ruin. With assumed unconcern he asked:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For any specific purpose, Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It has dawned upon me, Chaytor, that in my thoughts I may
have done injustice to one whom I loved and who loved me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The little girl, Annette?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The little girl, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But, speaking of love as you do, one would suppose that she
was a woman. Whereas she was a mere child when you last saw her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is true, and I speak of her only as a child. Chaytor,
there was something so sweet in Annette's nature that she grew in my heart as a
beloved sister might have done. To that length I went; no farther. Have you ever
felt the influence of a child's innocent love? It purifies you; it is a charm
against evil thoughts and evil promptings. Annette's affection was like an
amulet lying on my heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your object in returning to England would be to seek her
out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should endeavour to find her. Her silence may have been
enforced. She may be unhappy; I might be of service to her. There are other
reasons. I seem in this far-off country to be cut off from sympathy, from
humanizing influences. The life does not suit me. A man, after all, is not a
stone; he has duties, obligations, which he should endeavour to fulfil. You have
heard me speak of my uncle. He was kind to me for a great many years, up to the
point of my offending him. He is old: consideration is due to him. I should go
to him and say, 'I do not want your money; give it to whom you will, but let us
be friends.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A hundred to one that he would show you the door,&quot; said
Chaytor, who found in these revelations more than sufficient food for thought.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At all events I should have done my duty; but I think you are
mistaken. He has a tender heart under a rough exterior, and was always fond of
me, even, I believe, when he cast me off. I should not wonder if he has not
sometimes thought, 'Why did Basil take me at my word? Why did he not make
advances towards me?' He would be right in so thinking; I ought to have striven
for a reconcilement. But I was as obstinate as he was himself, and perhaps
prouder because I was poor. In a sort of way I defied him, and as good as said I
could do without him. I was wrong; I should have acted differently.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You seem to me, Basil,&quot; said Chaytor, slowly, &quot;to fall
somewhat into the same error in speaking of him as you do when you speak of
Annette. You speak of the little girl as if she was a woman; you speak of your
uncle as if he is living.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If he is dead I should learn the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I suppose that you would not leave the colony unless you were
rich?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think not; I should be placing myself in a false position.
We will not talk of it any more to-night, Chaytor. I am tired and shall go to
bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So shall I. The conversation has been a bit too sentimental
for me. Besides, when you say that you are cut off from sympathy and human
influences here, you are not paying me a very great compliment, after the
sacrifices I have made for you. But it is the way of the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, Chaytor,&quot; said Basil, with affectionate emphasis, &quot;I
never proposed that we should part. My hope was that we should go home together.
You are as much out of place here as I am. With your capacities and with money
in your pocket, you could carve a career in England which would make you
renowned.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is worth thinking of; but I must have your renewed
promise, Basil, that you will not throw up our partnership here till we have
made our fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I give you the promise. It would be folly to land in the old
country penniless.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So that the upshot of it is, that it all depends upon money.
In my opinion everything in life does.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do yourself an injustice, and are not speaking in your
usual vein. I daresay I am to blame for it. Forgive me, friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, there's nothing to forgive; but it <i>is</i> strange,
isn't it, that the first difference we have had should have sprung from the
prospect of our making our pile? Good night, old fellow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good night, Chaytor.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_22" href="#div1Ref_22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Chaytor lay awake that night, brooding. He found himself on
the horns of a dilemma, and all the cunning of his nature was needed to meet the
difficulty and overcome it successfully. The scheme he had laid, and very nearly
matured, had been formed and carried out in the expectation that the run of
ill-luck which had pursued him on the goldfields would continue. But now the
prospect was suddenly altered. Gold floated before his eyes; he saw the stuff in
the claim they were working more thickly studded than ever with the precious
metal; extravagant as were the calculations which Basil had worked out they were
not too extravagant for his imagination, and certainly not sufficiently
extravagant for his cupidity. There was no reason in the world why these
anticipations should not be more than fulfilled. Fabulous fortunes had been
realised on the goldfields before to-day--why should not the greatest that had
ever been made be theirs? He was compelled to take Basil into this calculation.
He could not work alone in the claim; a mate was necessary, and where should he
find one so docile as Basil? With all his heart he hated Basil, who seemed to
hold in his hands the fate of the man who had schemed to destroy him. Luck had
changed and the end he had in view must be postponed, must even, perhaps, be
ultimately abandoned. To turn his back upon the fortune within his grasp for a
problematical fortune in the old country was not to be dreamt of. The bird he
had in hand was worth infinitely more than the two he had in the bush--these two
being Annette and Basil's uncle. The result of his cogitations was that the
scheme upon which he had been engaged should remain in abeyance until it was
proved whether the gold they had struck in their claim was a flash in the pan,
or would hold out till their fortunes were made. In the former case he would
carry out his scheme to the bitter end: in the latter he would amass as much
money as he could, and then fly to America, where life would be almost as
enjoyable as in England. It was hardly likely, if Basil discovered his
treachery, that he would follow him for the mere purpose of revenge. &quot;He is not
vindictive,&quot; thought the rogue; &quot;he is a soft-hearted fool, and will let me
alone.&quot; Thus resolved, Chaytor waited for events. It is an example of the
tortuous reasoning by which villainy frequently seeks to justify itself that
Chaytor threw from his soul the responsibility of a contemplated crime, by
arguing that the result did not depend upon him but upon nature. If the claim
proved to be as rich as they hoped, Basil would be spared; if the gold ran out,
he must take the consequences. Having thus established that circumstance would
be the criminal, the evil-hearted man disposed himself for sleep.</p>

<p class="normal">He had not long to wait to decide which road he was to tread.
During the week they learned that their anticipations of wealth were not to be
realised. Each bucket of earth that was sent up from the shaft became poorer and
poorer, and from the last they obtained but a few grains of gold. The following
day they met with no better fortune; the rich patch was exhausted; the pocket in
which they had found the gold was empty.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Down tumble our castles,&quot; said Basil, with a certain
bitterness.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We may strike another rich patch,&quot; said Chaytor, and thought,
&quot;I will not wait much longer. I am sick of fortune's freaks; I will take the
helm again, and steer my ship into pleasure's bay.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He went to the township, openly for provisions and secretly to
see if there was any news from England. There were letters at the Post Office
awaiting Basil Whittingham, Esq. Chaytor put them in his pocket without opening
them, purchased some provisions, and set forth to rejoin Basil. He was more
careful in his movements than he had ever been. He had a premonition that the
unopened letters contained news of more than ordinary importance, and if he were
tracked and followed now his plans would be upset and all the trouble he had
taken thrown away. Basil and he were hidden from the world; no one knew of their
whereabouts, no person had any knowledge of their proceedings. Should Basil
disappear, who would suspect? Not a soul. Basil had not a friend or acquaintance
in all the colonies who was anxious for his safety or would be curious to know
what had become of him.</p>

<p class="normal">Midway between the township at which he had obtained Basil's
letters and the claim which had animated him with delusive hopes the schemer
halted for rest. He listened and looked about warily to make sure that no one
had followed him. Not a sound fell upon his ears, no living thing was within
hail. There are parts of the Australian woods which are absolutely voiceless for
twenty-three out of every twenty-four hours. This one hour, maybe, is rendered
discordant by the crows, whose harsh cries grate ominously upon the ear. At the
present moment, however, these pestilential birds were far away, and satisfied
that there was no witness of his proceedings, Chaytor threw himself upon the
earth and opened the letters. The first he read was from the lawyers, who had
already written to Basil in reply to the letters his false friend had forged. It
was to the following effect:--</p>
<br>

<p style="text-indent:10%">&quot;<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We write at the request of your uncle, Mr. Bartholomew
Whittingham, who, we regret to say, is seriously ill. He desires us to inform
you that he has abandoned the intention as to the disposition of his property
with which he made you acquainted before your departure from England. A will has
been drawn out and duly signed, constituting you his sole heir. Ordinarily this
would not have been made known to you until the occurrence of a certain event
which appears imminent, but our client wished it otherwise, and as doctors
happily are not invariably correct in their prognostications it may happen that
you will yet be in time to see him if you use dispatch upon the receipt of this
communication, and take ship for England without delay. To enable you to do this
we enclose a sight draft upon the Union Bank of Australia for five hundred
pounds, and should advise you to lose not a day in putting it to the use desired
by our client. It is our duty at the same time to say that we hold out no hope
that you will arrive in time. In the expectation of seeing you within a
reasonable period, and receiving your instructions, we have the honour to
remain,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50%">&quot;Your obedient servants,</p>

<p style="text-indent:60%">&quot;<span class="sc">Bulfinch &amp; Bulfinch</span>.&quot;</p>

<br>
<p class="normal">There was another letter from the lawyers:</p>
<br>

<p style="text-indent:10%">&quot;<span class="sc">&quot;Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Following our letter of yesterday's date we write to say that
we have been directed by your uncle Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham, to forward to
you the sealed enclosure which you will find herewith. We regret to inform you
that our client is sinking fast, and that the doctors who are attending him fear
that he cannot last through the week.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50%">&quot;We have the honour to remain,</p>
<p style="text-indent:55%">&quot;Your obedient servants,</p>
<p style="text-indent:60%">&quot;<span class="sc">Bulfinch &amp; Bulfinch</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Before unfastening the &quot;sealed enclosure,&quot; Chaytor rose in a
state of great excitement, and allowed his thoughts to find audible expression:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At last! Here is the certainty. No more Will-o'-the-wisps.
Fortune is mine--do you hear?--mine. Truly, justly mine. Who has worked for it
but I? Tell me that. Would the idiot Basil ever have humbled himself as I did;
would he ever have worked his old uncle as I have done? What is the result? I
softened the old fellow's heart, and the money he would have left to some
charity has fallen to me. Every labourer is worthy of his hire, and I am worthy
of mine. Basil would never have had one penny of the fortune, and therefore it
is my righteous due. At last, at last! No more sweating and toiling. The world
is before me, and I shall live the life of a gentleman. There is work still to
be done, both here and at home, and <i>I will do it</i>. No blenching, Chaytor;
no flinching now. What has to be done <i>must</i> and <i>shall</i> be done.
There is less danger in making the winning move than in upsetting the board
after the game I have played. Hurrah! Let me see what the precious 'enclosure'
has to say for itself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He broke the seal, and read:</p>
<br>

<p style="text-indent:10%">&quot;<span class="sc">My Dear Nephew Basil</span>,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My sands of life are running out, and before it is too late I
write to you, probably for the last time. You will be glad to hear from me
direct, I know, for your nature is different from mine, and your heart has
always been open to tender impressions. When I cast you from me I dare say you
suffered, but after my first unjust feeling of resentment was over my sufferings
have been far greater than yours could have been. It is the honest truth that in
abandoning you I abandoned the only real pleasure which life had for me; but my
obstinacy, dear lad, would not allow me to take steps towards a reconcilement.
It may be that had you done so I should still have hardened my heart against
you, and should have done you the injustice of thinking that you wished to
propitiate me for selfish motives. In these, as I believe them to be, the last
hours of my life, I have no wish to spare myself; I can see more clearly now
than I have done for many a long year, and my pride deserves no excuse. This
'pride' has been the bane of my life; it has sapped the fountains of innocent
enjoyment; it has enveloped me in a steel shroud which shut me out from love and
sympathy. You, and you alone, since I was a young man, were able to penetrate
this shroud, and even to you I showed only that worse side of myself by which
the world must have judged me. I did not give myself the trouble of inquiring
whether the counsel I was instilling into you was true or false; I see now that
it was false, and it is some comfort to me to know that your nature was too
simple and honourable, too loving and sympathetic, to be warped by it. Early in
life I met with a disappointment which soured me. There is no need to inscribe
that page in this letter--a loving letter, I beg you to believe. It was a
disappointment in love, and from the day I experienced it I became soured and
embittered. I was a poor man at the time, and I devoted myself to the task of
making money; I made it, and much good has it done me. With wealth at my command
I set up two dark starting points, which I allowed to influence me in every
question under consideration--one, money, the other human selfishness. These,
with a dogged and obstinate belief in the correctness of my own judgment on
every matter which came before me, made me what I have been. I had no faith, I
had no religion; my life was godless, and the attribute of selfishness which I
ascribed to the actions of all other men guided and controlled me in mine. You
never really saw me in my true character. That I regarded money as the greatest
good I did not conceal from you, but other sides of me, even more objectionable
than this, were not, I think, revealed to you. The mischief I would have done
you glanced off harmlessly, as the action you took in ruining yourself to pay
your father's debts proved. You were armed with an shield, my dear lad, a shield
in which shone the religious principle, honourable conduct, and faith in human
nature. Be thankful for that armour, Basil; it is not every man who is so
blessed. And let me tell you this. It is often an inheritance, and if not that,
it is often furnished by a mother's loving teaching and influence. You had the
sweetest of mothers; mine was of harder grain. I lay no blame upon her, nor, I
repeat, do I seek to excuse myself, but I would point out to you, as a small
measure of extenuation, that some of us are more fortunate than others in the
early training we receive, and in the possession of inherited virtues.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil, my dear lad, you did right in paying your father's
debts, despite the base view I expressed of your action. Angry that a step so
important should have been taken without my consent being asked, angry, indeed,
that it should have been taken at all, I said to myself, 'I will punish him for
it; I will teach him a lesson.' So I wrote you a heartless letter, informing you
that I had resolved to disinherit you, and suggesting that you should return the
money I had freely given you and which was justly yours. There are few men in
the world who would have treated that request as you did, and you could not have
dealt me a harder blow than when you forwarded me a cheque for the amount, with
interest added. Your independence, your manliness, hardened instead of softened
me; 'He does it to defy me,' I thought, and I allowed you to leave England under
the impression that the ties which had bound us together were irrevocably
destroyed. But the blow I aimed at you recoiled upon myself; your reply to my
mean and sordid request has been a bitter sting to me, and had you sought to
revenge yourself upon me you could not have accomplished your purpose more
effectually. I have always lived a lonely life, as you know; since I lost you my
home has been still more cheerless and lonesome; but I would not call you
back--no, my pride stopped me: I could not endure the thought that you or any
man should triumph over me. You see, my boy, I am showing you the contemptible
motives by which I was actuated; it is a punishment I inflict upon myself; and I
deserve the harshest judgment you could pass upon me. If my time were to come
over again, would I act differently? I cannot say. A man's matured character is
not easily twisted out of its usual grooves. I am as I have been made, or, to
speak more correctly, as I chose to make myself, and I have been justly
punished.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But, Basil, if the harvest I have gathered has been worthless
to me and to others, some good may result from it in the future. Not at my
hands, at yours. You are my sole heir, and you will worthily use the money I
leave you. I look forward to the years to come, and I see you in a happy home,
with wife and children around you, and it may be then that you will give me a
kind thought and that you will place a flower on my grave.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am greatly relieved by this confession. Good-bye, my lad,
and God bless you.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50%">&quot;Your affectionate Uncle.</p>

<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sentimental old party,&quot; mused Newman Chaytor, as he replaced
the letter in its envelope. &quot;If this had fallen into Basil's hands it would have
touched him up considerably. The old fellow had to give in after all, but it was
my letters that worked the oracle. The credit of the whole affair is mine, and
Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham ought to be very much obliged to me for soothing his
last hours.&quot; He laughed--a cruel laugh. &quot;As for the harvest he has gathered, I
promise him that it shall be worthily spent. He sees in the future his heir in a
happy home, with wife and children around him. Well!--perhaps. If all goes
smooth with the charming Annette, we'll see what we can do to oblige him. Now
let me read the little puss's letter; there may be something interesting in it.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear Basil&quot; (wrote Annette), &quot;I have something to tell
you. Uncle Gilbert has discovered that we have been corresponding with each
other, and there has been a scene. It came through aunt. The day before
yesterday they went out and left me and Emily together. From what they said I
thought they would have been gone a good many hours, and I got out my desk and
began to read your letters all over again. Do you know how many you have written
me? Seven; and I have every one of them, and mean to keep them always. After
reading them I sat down to write to you--a letter you will not receive, because
this will take its place, and because I had not written a dozen words before
aunt came in suddenly, and caught me bending over my desk. Seeing her, I was
putting my letter away (I never write to you when she is with me) when she came
close up to me and laid her hand on mine. 'What is that you are writing?' she
asked. 'A letter,' I replied. It was not very clever of me, but I did not for
the moment know what other answer to give. 'To whom?' she asked. 'To a friend,'
I said. 'Oh, you have friends,' she said; 'tell me who they are.' 'I have only
one,' I said, 'and I am writing to him.' 'And he has written to you?' she said.
'Yes,' I said, 'he has written to me.' 'Who is this only friend?' she asked; 'do
I know him?' 'Yes,' I said, 'you knew him slightly. There is no reason for
concealment; it is Basil, my dear father's friend.' 'Oh,' she said, 'your dear
father's friend. Is he in England, then?' 'No,' I answered, 'he is in
Australia.' 'His letters should have been addressed to the care of your uncle,'
she said, 'and that, I am sure, has not been the case, or they would have passed
through our hands. How have you obtained them?' 'It is my secret,' I replied.
Fortunately Emily was not in the room, and I do not think they have any
suspicion that she has been assisting me; if they had they would discharge her,
though I should fight against that. 'Your answers are evasive,' she said. 'They
are not, aunt,' I said; 'they are truthful answers.' 'Are you afraid,' she
asked, 'if the letters had been addressed to our care, as they ought to have
been, that they would not have been given to you?' I did not answer her, and she
turned away, and said she would inform Uncle Gilbert of the discovery she had
made. I did not go on with my first letter to you when she was gone; I thought I
would wait till Uncle Gilbert spoke to me. He did the same evening. 'Your aunt
has informed me,' he said, 'that you have been carrying on a correspondence with
that man named Basil, who so very nearly imposed upon your father in Australia.'
'That man, uncle,' I said, 'is a gentleman, and he did not try to impose upon my
father.' 'It will be to your advantage, my dear niece,' said Uncle Gilbert, very
quietly, 'not to bandy words with me, nor say things which may interfere with
your freedom and comfort. I am your guardian, and dispute it as you may, I stand
in your father's place. To carry on a clandestine correspondence with a young
man who is no way related to you is improper and unmaidenly. May I inquire if
there is any likelihood of your correspondent favouring us with a visit?' 'I
hope I shall see him one day,' I said. 'There is a chance of it then,' he said,
'and you can probably inform me when we may expect him.' 'No, I cannot tell you
that,' I said. 'Your aunt believes,' he said, 'that you are not speaking the
truth when you answer questions we put to you.' 'All my answers are truthful
ones,' I said. 'You refuse to tell us,' he said, 'by what means this secret
correspondence has been carried on.' 'I refuse to tell you,' I answered. 'I will
not press you,' he said, 'but it will be my duty to discover what you are hiding
from me. I shall succeed; I never undertake a task and fail. I always carry it
out successfully to the end. In the meantime this correspondence must cease.' 'I
will not promise,' I said, 'anything I do not mean to fulfil.' 'That is an
honest admission,' he said, 'and I admire you for it. Nevertheless, the
correspondence must cease, and if you persist in it I shall find a way to put a
stop to it. Your reputation, your good name is at stake, and I must guard you
from the consequences of your imprudence. My dear niece, I fear that you are
bent upon opposing my wishes. It is an unequal battle between you and me--I tell
you so frankly. You are under my control, and I intend to exercise my authority.
We will now let the matter drop.' And it did drop there and then, and not
another word has been spoken on the subject.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There, Basil, I have told you everything as far as I can
recollect it. I might be much worse off than I am. But it would be different if
I did not have you to think of, if I did not feel that I have a dear, dear
friend in the world, though he is so many thousands of miles away, and that some
day I shall see him again. It is something to look forward to, and not a day
passes that I do not think of it. You remember the books you used to tell me of
on the plantation. I have read them all again and again, and they are all
delightful. If the choice were mine, and you were to be near me, or with me as
my dear father wished, I should dearly like to live the old life on the
plantation; but there would be a difference, Basil; I could not live it now
without books, and I do not see how anybody could. Often do I believe them to be
real, and when I have laid down one which has made me laugh and cry I feel as if
I had made new friends with whom I can rejoice and sympathise. There will be
plenty to talk of when we meet, for that we shall meet some day I have not the
least doubt. Only if you would grow rich, and come home soon, it would be so
beautiful. Really and truly, Basil, I want a friend, a true friend to talk to
about things. 'About what things, Annette?' perhaps you ask. How shall I
explain? I will try--only you must remember that I am older than when we were
together on the plantation, and that, as Uncle Gilbert implied, in a year or two
I shall be a woman.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil, when that time comes I want to have more freedom than
I have now; I do not want to feel as if I were in chains; but how shall I be
able to set myself free without a friend like you by my side? I do not think I
am clever, but one can't help thinking of things. I understand that when my dear
father died Uncle Gilbert was doing what he had a right to do in becoming my
guardian and taking care of the money that was left. Emily says it is all mine,
but I do not know. If it is, I should be glad to give half of it to Uncle
Gilbert if he would agree to shake hands with me and bid me good-bye. We should
be ever so much better friends apart from each other. I did venture timidly to
speak to him once about my dear father's property, but he only said, 'Time
enough, time enough; there is no need to trouble yourself about it; wait till
you are a good many years older.' But, Basil, I want to be free before I am a
good many years older, and how is that to be managed without your assistance?
That is what I mean when I say I want a true friend to talk about things.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must leave off soon; Emily says the mail for Australia
leaves to-day, and this letter has to be posted. I am writing it very early in
the morning in my bedroom, before uncle and aunt are up; it is fortunate that
they do not rise till late. But to be compelled to write in this way--do you
understand now what I mean when I say that I do not want to feel as if I were in
chains? Emily says she will manage to post the letter for me without uncle and
aunt knowing, and I hope she will be able to. Of course it would be ridiculous
for me to suppose that Emily and I can be a match for Uncle Gilbert, for I am
certain he is watching me, though there is no appearance of it. The way he talks
and the way he looks sometimes puts me in mind of a fox.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-bye, Basil. Do not forget me, and if you do not hear
from me for a long time do not think I have forgotten you. I can never, never,
do that. Oh, how I wish time would pass quickly!</p>

<p style="text-indent:50%">&quot;Always yours affectionately,</p>
<p style="text-indent:65%">&quot;<span class="sc">Annette</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">When he finished reading Annette's letter Newman Chaytor
looked at the date and saw that it had been written a month earlier than the
letter from the lawyers. Examining the postmark on the envelope he saw that it
could not have been posted till three weeks after it had been written, and that
it bore a French stamp.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The little puss was not in England,&quot; he thought, &quot;when she
contrived to get this letter popped into the post. That shows that she was right
in supposing that Uncle Gilbert was watching her. Sly old fox, Uncle Gilbert. He
means to keep tight hold of the pretty Annette. Saint George to the rescue! I
feel quite chivalrous, and as if I were about to set forth to rescue maidens in
distress. She is not quite devoid of sense, this Annette; it will be an
entertainment to have a bout with Uncle Gilbert on her behalf. He saw very
little of Basil, and if we resembled each other much less than we do it would be
scarcely possible for him to suspect that another man was playing Basil's part
in this rather remarkable drama. Time, circumstance, everything is in my
favour--but I wish the next few weeks were over.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The harsh cawing of crows aroused him from his musings. Their
grating voices were a fit accompaniment to his cruel thoughts. With a set,
determined face, and with a heart in which dwelt no compunction for the deed he
was about to do, he turned his face towards the spot where Basil, unsuspicious
of the fate in store for him, was awaiting the comrade in whom he had put his
trust.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_23" href="#div1Ref_23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">In Australia, as in all new countries where treasure is
discovered or where land is not monopolised by the few, townships spring up like
mushrooms. Some grow apace, and become places of importance; others, in which
the promise which brought them into existence is unfulfilled, languish and die
out, to share the fate of the township of Gum Flat, in which Basil had met the
man who played him false. Shortly after the events which have been recorded, a
party of prospectors halted in a valley some eight miles from the valley where
Basil and Newman Chaytor had been working, and began to look for gold. Their
search was rewarded, the precious metal was found in paying quantities, and
miners flocked to the valley and spread themselves over the adjacent country.
The name of one of the early prospectors was Prince, and a township being
swiftly formed, there was a certain fitness in dubbing it Princetown. All the
adjuncts of a town which bade fair to be prosperous were soon gathered together.
At the heels of the gold-diggers came the storekeepers, with tents in which to
transact their business, and drayloads of goods wherewith to stock their stores.
The tide, set going, flowed rapidly, and in less than a fortnight Princetown was
a recognised centre of the rough civilisation which reigns in such-like places.
Storekeepers, publicans, auctioneers, plied their trade from morning till night,
and the gold, easily obtained, was as easily parted with by the busy bees, who
lived only for the day and thought not of the morrow. The scene, from early
morning till midnight, was one of remarkable animation, replete with strange
features which a denizen of old-time civilisation, being set suddenly in its
midst, would have gazed upon with astonishment. Here was a cattle-yard, in which
horses for puddling machines and drays, and sheep and oxen for consumption, were
being knocked down to the highest bidder during ten hours of the day. A large
proportion of the horses purchased by the miners were jibbers and buckjumpers,
and a very Babel of confusion reigned in the High Street as they strove to lead
away their purchases. Around each little knot of mates who had bought a jibber
or a buckjumper a number of idlers gathered, shouting with derision or approval
when the horse or the man was triumphant. Exciting struggles between the two
were witnessed; men jumped upon unsaddled horses and were thrown into the air
amid the yells of the spectators, only to jump on again and renew the contest.
Here an attempt was being made to pull along a jibber, whose forelegs were
firmly planted before it, while twenty whips were being cracked at its heels to
urge it on in the desired direction. A dozen yards off, up and out went the
heels of a buckjumping brute, scattering the crowd, and for a moment victorious.
Nobody was seriously hurt, bruises being reckoned of no account by these
wanderers from the home-land, who for the first time in their lives were
breathing the air of untrammelled freedom. It was wonderful to observe the
effects of the newer life which was pulsing in the veins of the adventurers. At
home they would have walked to and from their work, or idled in the streets
because work was not to be obtained, listless and spiritless, mere commonplace
mortals with pale faces, and often hopeless eyes. Here it was as if fresh,
vigorous young blood had been infused into them. The careless, easy dress, the
manly belt with its fossicking knife in sheath, the ragged and graceful
billycock hat, the lissome movements of their limbs, the hair flowing upon their
breasts, transformed them from drudges into something very like heroes. Seldom
anywhere in the world can finer specimens of manhood be seen than on these new
goldfields; it is impossible to withhold admiration of the manlier qualities
which have sprung into life with the free labour in which their days are
engaged. It is true that liberty often degenerates into lawless licence, but the
vicious attributes of humanity must be taken into account, and they are as
conspicuous in these new scenes, mayhap, as in the older grooves; and although
crime and vice are met with, their proportion is no larger--indeed, it is not so
large--than is made manifest by statistics in the older orders of civilisation.
Next to the cattle sale-yard is a small store in which the wily gold-buyer is
fleecing and joking with the miner who comes to change virgin gold into coined
sovereigns or the ragged bank notes of Australian banks. Next to the
gold-buyer's tent is a stationer who, for the modest sum of half-a-crown, will
give a man an envelope, a sheet of notepaper, and pen and ink, with which he can
write a letter to a distant friend. It was an amazing charge, but it was not
uncommon during the first few weeks of life on a new goldfield, and the wonder
of it was that men who toiled in the old countries for little more than
half-a-crown a day slapped down the coin without a murmur against the extortion.
Next to the stationer was a canvas hotel, wherein thimblefuls of brandy and
whiskey were retailed at a shilling the nobbler, and Bass's pale ale at two
shillings the pint bottle. Then clothes stores, provision stores, general
stores, dancing and billiard saloons, branches of great banks, with flags waving
over their fronts, and all driving a roaring trade. The joyousness of prosperity
was apparent in every animate sign that met the view, and a rollicking freedom
of manner was established, very much as if it were an order of freemasonry which
made all men brothers. Here was a man who in England never had three sovereigns
to &quot;bless himself with&quot; (a favourite saying, which has its meaning) calling upon
every person in sight--strangers to him, every man Jack of them--to come and
drink at his expense at the usual shilling a thimbleful, throwing to the
bartender a dirty banknote, and pocketing the change without condescending to
count it. At present the circulation was confined to bank notes, sovereigns and
silver money. Coppers were conspicuous by their absence, and, falling into
miners' hands, would very likely be pitched away with scorn. The lowest price
for anything was sixpence, whether it was a packet of pins or a yard of tape--a
very paradise for haberdashers with their eternal three farthings. The man who
was standing treat all round, and the more the merrier, had been a dockyard
labourer in London, a grovelling grub, who at the end of the week had not
twopence to spare, and probably would have been glad to accept that much charity
from the hands of the kindly-hearted. In Princetown he was a lord, and just now
seemed bent upon getting as drunk as one. He had struck a new lead, and on this
day had washed out more than he would have received for two years' labour at
home. Small wonder that his head was turned; small wonder for his belief that he
was in possession of a Midas mine of wealth which would prove inexhaustible.
Thus in varied form ran the story of these newly-opened goldfields with their
delirious excitements and golden hopes. A new era had dawned upon mankind, and
bone and muscle were the valuable commodities. So believed the miners, the kings
of the land; the bush roads teemed with them, and a tramp of a hundred miles was
thought nothing of. Their swags on their backs, they marched through bush and
forest, and lit their camp fires at night, and sat round the blazing logs,
smoking, singing, and telling bush yarns until, healthfully tired out with their
day's labour, they wrapped themselves in their blankets and slept soundly with
the stars shining on them. Up they rose in the morning, as merry as Robin Hood's
men, and drawing water from the creek in which they washed, made their tea and
baked their &quot;damper,&quot; then shouldered their swags again, and resumed their
cheerful march. Soldiers of civilisation they, opening up a new country in which
fortunes were made and work honestly paid for. No room for that pestilential
brood, the hydra-headed middleman, who pays the producer a shilling for his
wares, and, passing it on from hand to hand delivers it to the consumer at six
times its proper value. It is this multiplying process which makes life so hard
to hundreds of thousands in the overcrowded countries of the old-world.</p>

<p class="normal">Some passing features of the sudden creation of Princetown
have been given, but one remains to be introduced. Exactly twelve days from the
discovery of gold in the valley, an ancient horse of lean proportions, dragging
a crazy old waggon behind it, halted in the High Street in the early part of the
day. By the side of the tired animal was a pale-faced man, who never once used
his worn-out whip, but gave kindly words to his steed in the place of lashes. He
was poorly dressed and looked wan and anxious. When he halted there descended
from the waggon a woman as pale-faced and anxious as himself and a little girl
brimming over with life and spirits. The woman was his wife, the little girl his
daughter. The frontages to the most desirable allotments had been pegged out a
long way north and south, and there were speculators who had no intention of
occupying those allotments themselves, but were prepared to sell their rights to
newcomers. After a few inquiries and some shrewd examination of the allotments,
the man bargained for one in a suitable position, and became its owner. Then
from the waggon was taken a tent of stout canvas, and while the old horse ate
its corn and bent its head to have its nose stroked by the little girl, the man
and woman set to work to build their habitation. In the course of the afternoon
this was done, and then, after an <i>al fresco</i> repast, the waggon was
unloaded of its contents. This process aroused the curiosity of the loungers in
High Street, Princetown, the goods being of an unusual character. Mysterious
looking articles were taken out of the waggon and conveyed with great care into
the tent, and presently one onlooker, better informed than his comrades, cried:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, it's a printing-office!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A printing-office it was, of the most modest description, but
still, a printing-office; that engine of enlightenment without which the wheels
of civilisation would cease to revolve. The word was passed round, the news
spread, and brought other contingents of spectators, and the canvas tent became
a temple, and the pale-faced man a man of mark. Inside the temple the woman was
arranging the type and cases, putting up without assistance two single frames
and a double one; outside the man was answering, or endeavouring to answer, the
eager questions asked of him, extracting at the same time, for his own behoof,
such scraps of information as would prove useful to him. Pale as was his face,
and anxious as was the look in his eyes, he was a man of energy and resource.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mates,&quot; he cried, &quot;look out to-morrow morning for the first
number of the <i>Princetown Argus</i>. Who'll subscribe?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will,&quot; and &quot;I will,&quot; answered a dozen voices, and the
enterprising printer, who had staked his all on the venture, was immediately
engaged in receiving subscriptions for his newspaper, and entering the names in
a memorandum book. His face became flushed, the anxious look fled from his eyes;
in less than half an hour he had thirty pounds in his pockets.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go and get me some news,&quot; he said, addressing his audience
generally. &quot;Never mind what it is, I'll put it into shape.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;William,&quot; cried the woman from the tent, &quot;you must come and
help me to put up the press.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While the two were thus engaged, a good-natured fellow in the
open took upon himself the task of receiving additional subscribers and when the
press was set up, and the master printer made his appearance again, a matter of
twenty pounds was handed to him by his self-constituted lieutenant.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fifty pounds,&quot; whispered the adventurer to his wife. &quot;A good
start.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She nodded, beaming, and proceeded with her work, assisted by
her husband. He had announced the initial number of the <i>Princetown Argus</i>
for the next morning, and out it would have to come. This would necessitate
their stopping up all night, but what did the matter? They were establishing a
property, and, were already regarded as perhaps the most important arrival in
the new township. In the middle of their work a visitor presented himself. The
printer was spreading ink upon the ink table and getting his roller in order,
when his visitor opened up a conversation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The <i>Princetown Argus</i>, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A good move. The first number to-morrow morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can it be done?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the printer confidently. &quot;When I say done,
done it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's your sort. How many pages?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Two. The second number four.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you ask for the whole of the front page in the first
four numbers? I've a mind to advertise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The proposal staggered the printer, but he did not show it;
the woman pricked up her ears.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A hundred pounds,&quot; replied the printer, amazed at his own
boldness.</p>

<p class="normal">The visitor nodded, as if a hundred pounds for an
advertisement were an every-day occurrence with him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With the option,&quot; he said, &quot;of the next four numbers at the
same price.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can have the option,&quot; said the printer, who could not yet
be called a newspaper proprietor, because his journal was in embryo.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you got some bold type? Big letters?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. My plant is small at present, but I can do job printing
as well as newspaper work. That's what I'm here for. I shall be getting new type
sent out in a week or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Show me 'John Jones' in big letters.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was done almost instantaneously, and the visitor gazed at
the name approvingly. It was his own.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, underneath, 'Beehive Stores.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The letters were put together, and the printer said, &quot;That
will look well, right across the page.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">John Jones nodded again. &quot;Now, underneath that, 'The Beehive,
the Beehive, The Only Beehive. John Jones John Jones, The only John Jones. Look
out for the Flag, Painted by the Finest Artist of the Age.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go slow,&quot; said the printer. &quot;All right, I'm up to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Buy everything you Want,&quot; proceeded John Jones, watching the
nimble fingers with admiration, &quot;'at the only Beehive, of the only John Jones.
Groceries, Provisions, Clothing of every description, Picks and Shovels, Powder
and Fuse, Candles, Tubs and Dishes, Crockery, Bottled Ale and Stout, Everything
of the Very Best. The highest price given for Gold. Come One, Come All. The Only
Beehive. The Only John Jones. The Flag that's Braved a Thousand Years the Battle
and the Breeze. Good luck to all.' There, that's the advertisement. Spread it
out, you know. Here's the hundred pounds. You might give me a paragraph.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll do that,&quot; said the printer. &quot;Something in this style:
'We have much pleasure in directing our readers' attention to the advertisement
of out enterprising townsman, John Jones, the Beehive Stores, at whose emporium
gold-diggers and others will find the finest stock of goods,' &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Will
that do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Capitally,&quot; said John Jones. &quot;Put me down as a subscriber.&quot;
And off went the enterprising storekeeper, satisfied with his outlay and that it
would bring him a good return. Both he and William Simmons, the founder of <i>
The Princetown Argus</i>, are types. It is opportunity that makes the man.</p>

<p class="normal">The midnight oil was burned in the new printing-office until
the sun rose next morning. Not a wink of sleep did William Simmons or his wife
have; she was almost as expert a compositor as her husband, and she is presented
to the reader standing before her case, composing-stick in hand, picking up
stamps, as a woman worthy of the highest admiration. When she paused in her work
it was to have a peep at her little girl, who was sleeping soundly, and to stoop
and give her darling a kiss. William Simmons was the busiest of men the whole of
the time, in and out of the tent, running here and there to pick up scraps, of
information for paragraphs and short articles, and setting up his leading
article, introducing <i>The Princetown Argus</i> to the world, literally &quot;out of
his head,&quot; for he did not write it first and put it in type afterwards, but
performed the feat, of which few compositors are capable, that of making his
thoughts take the place of &quot;copy.&quot; At ten o'clock in the morning the first copy
of the newspaper was produced, William Simmons being the pressman and Mrs.
Simmons the roller boy. It is a curiosity in its way, and readers at the British
Museum should look it up. There was a great demand for copies, and Simmons and
his wife did their best to supply it, but they could not hold out longer than
twelve o'clock, at which hour they shut up shop, and, throwing themselves upon
some blankets on the ground, enjoyed the repose which they had so worthily
earned. Before they awoke something took place which created a great stir in the
township, and news of it was conveyed to the office of <i>The Princetown Argus</i>.
Aroused from their sleep, the printer and his wife were up and astir again, and
getting his material together, William Simmons, on the following day, issued an
&quot;extra edition&quot; of his paper, the principal item of which is given in the next
chapter.</p>

<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;A sad discovery&quot; (wrote the editor and proprietor of <i>The
Princetown Argus</i>) &quot;was yesterday made on a spot some dozen miles from
Princetown, which we hasten to place before our readers in the shape of an extra
edition of our journal, the success of the first number of which, we are happy
to say, has exceeded our most glowing anticipations. We ask the inhabitants of
Princetown to accept the issue of this our first extra edition as a guarantee of
the spirit with which we intend to conduct the newspaper which will represent
their interests. The facts of the discovery we refer to are as follows:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At the distance we have named from Princetown runs the
Plenteous river, towards which the eyes of our enterprising miners have been
already turned as the source from which, when our creeks run dry, we shall have
to obtain our water supply. The party of miners who have formed themselves into
a company for the purpose of sluicing a portion of the ground in Fairman's Flat,
deputed two of their number, Joseph Porter and Steve Fairfax to make an
inspection of the lay of the land between Plenteous River and Fairman's Flat, to
decide upon the feasibility of cutting a water race, and upon the best means of
carrying out the design. The ground they hold has been proved to be highly
auriferous, and there is no doubt that rich washings-out will reward their
enterprise. It was not to be expected that they would make their examination
without prospecting the ground here and there, and the reports they have brought
in seem to establish the fact that the whole of the country between Princetown
and the Plenteous River constitutes one vast goldfield. The future of our
township is assured, and within a short time its position will be second to none
in all Australia. The report of Porter and Fairfax is also highly favourable to
the contemplated water race, and the work will be commenced at once. It is
calculated that there are already six thousand miners in Princetown. We have
room for five times six thousand, and we extend the hand of welcome to our new
comrades.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Upon the arrival of Porter and Fairfax at the Plenteous River
they naturally concluded they were the first on the ground, no accounts of any
gold workings thereabouts having been published in any of the Australian
journals. They soon discovered their error. Work had been done on the banks of
the river, as was shown by the heaps of tailings in different places, and on one
of the ranges sloping upwards from the banks a shaft had been sunk. At no great
distance from the shaft a small tent was set up, and the two men proceeded to it
for the purpose of making inquiries. Although the tent presented evidences of
having been quite recently occupied, no person was visible, and they came to the
conclusion that its owner was at work in another direction and would return at
the close of day. Their curiosity induced them to examine the shaft which had
been sunk on the range, and this examination led to an important result. There
was no windlass over the shaft, but a rope securely fastened at the top hung
down the mouth. They shook the rope, and ascertained that it hung loose. To
their repeated calls down the shaft they received no reply, and they pulled up
the rope. To their surprise there were not more than twelve feet of rope hanging
down, whereas the stuff that had been hauled up indicated a depth of some forty
or fifty feet. A closer examination of the rope showed that it had been broken
at a part where it had got frayed and unable to bear a heavy weight. Being
provided with a considerable length of rope the men resolved to descend the
shaft and ascertain whether an accident had occurred. Having made their rope
fast, Fairfax descended, and reaching the bottom was horrified to discover a man
lying there senseless and apparently dead. As little time as possible was lost
in getting him to the top, a work of considerable difficulty and danger, but it
was accomplished safely after great labour. Then came the task of ascertaining
whether the man was dead. He was not; but although he exhibited signs of life
the injuries he received were of such a nature that they feared there was little
hope for him. It was impossible for Fairfax and Porter to convey him to
Princetown without a horse and cart, and Fairfax hurried back to the township to
obtain what was necessary, while Porter remained at the Plenteous River to nurse
the injured man. He has been brought here, and is now being well looked after.
The latest reports of him are more favourable, and hopes are entertained that
his life may be saved. He has not yet, however, recovered consciousness, and
nothing is known as to his name. Neither is anything absolutely precise known of
the circumstances of the accident, except that it was caused by the breaking of
the rope, a portion of which was found at the bottom of the shaft, tightly
clenched in the stranger's hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is a certain element of mystery in the affair, and we
shall briefly allude to one or two points which seem to have a bearing upon it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fairfax and Porter, to whose timely arrival at Plenteous
River the stranger undoubtedly owes his life, if it is spared, are of the
opinion that there were two men working in the shaft and living together in the
tent. Upon the former point they may be mistaken, for the rope was so fixed that
a man working by himself could ascend and descend the shaft with comparative
ease, although the labour of filling each bucket of stuff below and then
ascending to the top to draw it up, would have been excessive. But upon the
latter point there can be no doubt, for the reason that the tent contained two
beds, both of which must have been lain upon within the last week or two.
Inferring that there <i>were</i> two men working in the shaft, is it possible,
when the accident occurred, that the man at the top of the shaft made tracks
from the place and left his mate to a cruel and lingering death? This is a mere
theory, and we present it for what it is worth. An opinion has been expressed
that the rope has been tampered with, and that it did not break from natural
wear and tear. If so, it strengthens the theory we have presented. Nothing was
found in the pockets of the injured man which could lead to his identity, nor
was any gold found upon his person or in the tent. Thus, for the present, the
affair is wrapt in mystery.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In the next week's number of the <i>Princetown Argus</i> the
incident was again referred to in a leading article, in which a number of other
matters found mention:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The man who was found at the bottom of a shaft on a range at
the Plenteous River and was brought to Princetown to have his injuries attended
to, is now conscious and in a fair way of recovery. But, whether from a set
purpose or from the circumstance that his mental powers have been impaired from
the injuries he received, he is singularly reticent about the affair. He has
volunteered no information, and his answers to questions addressed to him throw
no light upon the mystery. It is expected that several weeks will elapse before
he can recover his strength. Meanwhile we have to record that gold has been
found in paying quantities in the banks of the river and in the adjacent ranges,
and it is calculated that there are already five hundred men at work there. Gold
is also being discovered in various parts of the country between Princetown and
the river, and a great many claims are being profitably worked. The rush of
gold-diggers to Princetown continues, and men are pouring in every day.
Yesterday the gold escort took down 4,300 ounces; it is expected that this
quantity will be doubled next week. Our enterprising townsman, Mr. John Jones,
of the famous Beehive Stores, is having a wooden building erected in which his
extensive business will in future be transacted. We direct the attention of our
readers to Mr. Jones' advertisement on our front page. The enterprising
proprietor of the Royal Hotel has determined to construct a movable theatre,
also of wood, which will be put up every evening in the cattle sale-yards
adjoining his hotel when the sales of the day are over, and taken down after
every performance to allow of the sales being resumed the next morning. This is
a novel idea, and will be crowned with success. A first-class company is on its
way to Princetown, and it is announced that the first performance will be given
in a fortnight. Fuller particulars of these matters will be found in other
columns. Our readers will observe that we have doubled the size of the <i>
Princetown Argus</i>, which now consists of four pages. We have ordered an
entire new plant, and upon its arrival shall still further enlarge our paper.
Our motto is Onward.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It will be seen from these extracts that Newman Chaytor had
carried out his cruel scheme to what he believed and hoped would be the end of
the comrade he had plotted against and betrayed. But what man proposes sometimes
fails in its purpose, and it was so in this instance. The merciful arrival of
the two gold-diggers upon the scene saved Basil's life.</p>

<p class="normal">This last act of Chaytor's was easily accomplished. While
Basil slept he crawled to the shaft, and by the moon's light weakened the
strands of the rope some ten feet down. Then he crawled back to his bed, and
tossed to and fro till the dawn of day.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We'll work the claim till the end of the week,&quot; he said to
Basil over breakfast, &quot;and if it turns out no better, we will try the banks of
the river again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very well,&quot; said Basil. &quot;I am truly sorry I don't bring you
better luck, but we have something to go on with, at all events.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They walked to the shaft together, and Basil prepared to
descend. Grasping the rope, he looked up at Chaytor, and Chaytor smiled at him.
He responded with a cheerful look, for although the hopes in which he had
indulged of returning to England with a fortune were destroyed, he had not
abandoned his wish to leave the colony. He was sick of the life he was leading,
and he yearned for a closer human sympathy. His share of the gold they had
obtained would be close upon five hundred pounds--that was something; it would
enable him to take passage home, to find Annette perhaps, to see and speak with
her and renew the old bond; and if the worst happened, if he could not find
Annette, or found her only to learn that the woman was different from the child,
he could come back to Australia and live out his life there.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't lose heart,&quot; he said to Chaytor; &quot;we may strike the
vein again this week. There's a bright future before you, I am certain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I half believe so myself,&quot; said Chaytor; &quot;hoping against
hope, you know.&quot; And thought, &quot;Will he never go down?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil gave one upward look at the floating clouds and
descended. Chaytor bent over the mouth of the shaft, looked down, and listened.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is the rope firm?&quot; Basil cried out.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite firm,&quot; said Chaytor. Then there came a terrified
scream, and the sound of a heavy body falling. Then--silence.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor, with white face and lips tightly set, still bent over
the mouth of the shaft, still looked down the dark depths, still listened. Not a
sound--not even a groan.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is done,&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p class="normal">He pulled up the severed rope, and thought that it might have
happened without his intervention. He had read of a parallel instance, and of
the death of a miner in consequence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was an accident,&quot; he said, &quot;as this is. The rope would
have given way without my touching it. Such things occur all over the world.
Look at the colliery accidents at home--hundreds of men are killed in them, here
there is only one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">These thoughts were not prompted by compunction; he simply
desired to shift the responsibility from his own shoulders. It was a miserable
subterfuge, and did not succeed. In the first flush of his crime its shadow
haunted him.</p>

<p class="normal">He let the rope fall from his hand down the shaft. &quot;I could
not go to him,&quot; he said, &quot;if I wanted. How quiet he is!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A mad impulse seized him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil Basil!&quot; he cried in his loudest tone; and as no reply
reached him, he said, looking around, &quot;Well, then, is it my fault that he does
not answer me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He paced to and fro, a dozen steps this way, a dozen that,
counting his steps. Fifty times at least he did this, always with the intention
of going to the tent or the river, and always being drawn back to the mouth of
the shaft, over which he hung and lingered. It possessed a horrible fascination
for him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I <i>will</i> go this time,&quot; he said, but he could not. He
remained an hour--the longest hour in his life. At length he went down to the
river, and as he gazed upon it thought, &quot;Men die by drowning. What does it
matter the kind of death? Death is death: it is always the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The interminable hours lagged on till night came. He sat in
the tent weighing the gold and getting ready for flight. Once in Sydney he would
take the first ship for England. The flickering candle cast monstrous shadows
upon the walls and ceiling, and in his nervous state he shrank shudderingly from
them, and strove to ward them off, as though they were living forms hovering
about him with fell intent. The silence appalled him; he would have given gold
for the piping of a little bird.</p>

<p class="normal">Thus passed the miserable night, and in the morning he visited
the shaft again. The same awful stillness reigned.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is all over,&quot; he said. &quot;Newman Chaytor is dead; I, Basil
Whittingham, live. No one will ever know. Now for England!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_25" href="#div1Ref_25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Occasionally in a man's life comes a pause: as between the
acts of a drama action slumbers awhile--only that the march through life's
season never halts. The pulse of time throbs silently and steadily until the
natural span is reached, or is earlier snapped, and the bridge between mortality
and immortality is crossed. Meanwhile the man grows older--that is all. For him
upon the tree of experience there is neither blossom nor bloom; bare branches
spread out, naked of hope, and he gazes upon them in dumb wonderment or despair.
The hum of woodland life, the panorama of wondrous colour, the unceasing growth
of life out of death, the warlike sun, the breath of peace in moon and stars,
the eternal pn that all nature sings, bear no message to his soul. He walks, he
eats, he sleeps, and waits unconsciously for the divine touch that shall arouse
him from his trance.</p>

<p class="normal">Something of this kind occurred to Basil. Recovering from the
physical injuries he had sustained, he sank into an apathetic state which, but
for some powerful incentive, might have been morally fatal. Friends he had none,
or the effort might have been made; so for a year after Newman Chaytor had left
Australia he plodded aimlessly on, working for wages which kept him in food, and
desiring nothing more. Upon the subject of his mate's desertion he preserved
silence, as indeed he did upon most other subjects, but it might reasonably have
been expected that upon this theme in which he was directly interested he would
have been willing to open his mind. It was not so. To questions addressed to him
he returned brief and unsatisfactory answers, and after a time nothing further
was asked of him. Curiosity died out; if he chose to keep himself aloof it was
his business, and in the new world, as in the old, every man's affairs were
sufficient to occupy him without troubling himself about strangers. Thus it
would appear that the scheme upon which Newman Chaytor had bent all his energies
was destined to be in every way successful.</p>

<p class="normal">With respect to the desertion and the disappearance of the
gold, an equal share of which was rightfully and lawfully his, Basil had arrived
at a definite conclusion. He entertained no doubt that the rope had broken
naturally; suspicion of foul play did not cross his mind. He argued that
Chaytor, believing him to be dead, had taken the gold and left the claim they
had been working in disgust. &quot;He made no secret,&quot; thought Basil, &quot;that he was
sick of the life we were leading. To have gone away and left my share of the
gold behind him--I being, as he supposed, dead--would have been an act of folly.
I do not blame him; good luck go with him. He stuck to me to the last, and
proved himself my friend when most I needed one. Let my life go on as it will; I
will think nothing and say nothing to his injury.&quot; A vindictive man would have
argued otherwise, would have thought that it was at least a comrade's duty,
before he left the spot, to convince himself by ocular proof that the fall was
fatal. But Basil was not vindictive; he believed he had the best of reasons to
be grateful to Chaytor, and if the gold his mate had taken was any repayment for
services rendered in the past, he was welcome to it. The strong moral principle
in Basil's nature kept him from yielding to temptations against which not all
men struggle successfully when misfortune persistently dogs them. He led an
honest life of toil, without ambition to lift himself to a higher level. But
happily an awakening was in store for him, and it came through the sweetest and
most humanising of influences.</p>

<p class="normal">Princetown throve apace; its promise was fulfilled, and twenty
thousand men found prosperous lodgment therein. The majority delved, the
minority traded, most of them throve. To be sure some were unfortunate, and some
idled and dissipated, but this must always be expected. New leads were
discovered, quartz reefs were opened, crushing machines were put up, streets
were formed, a fire brigade was established, a benevolent institute and a
lunatic asylum were founded. Not even a mushroom town in these new countries can
exist without something in the shape of a municipal council, and one was formed
in Princetown, over the elections for which there was prodigious excitement.
Churches and chapels, even a synagogue, were erected by voluntary contributions,
and there were churchyards in which already wanderers found rest. All the
important buildings were now of wood, and there was a talk of stone, the primal
honour of erecting which was presently to fall to John Jones, the enterprising
proprietor of the Only Beehive. The <i>Princetown Argus</i> shared in the
general prosperity. First a weekly, then a bi-weekly, then a tri-weekly, finally
a daily. First, two pages, the size of the <i>Globe</i>, then four pages ditto,
finally four pages, the size of the <i>Times</i>. Not a bad sample of enterprise
this. The Saturday edition was eight pages, to serve the purpose of a weekly as
well as a daily, and in it was published a novel, &quot;to be continued in our next,&quot;
which the editor took from a London monthly magazine, and for which, in the
innocence of his heart, he paid nothing. Of course there was an opposition
journal, but the
<i>Princetown Argus</i> had taken the lead, and kept it in the face of all
newcomers. The shrewd editor and proprietor did one piece of business with a
more than usually obstinate rival which deserves to be recorded. He bought up an
opposition paper, the <i>Princetown Herald</i>, whose politics were the reverse
of those he advocated, and for a considerable time he ran the two papers on
their original lines, each attacking the other's principles and policy with
fierce zest and vigour. Thus he occupied both fields of public opinion, and
threw sops to all who took an interest in local and colonial politics. And here
a word in the shape of information which will surprise many readers. England is
overrun with newspapers; the United States is more than overrun, having nearly
three to our one; but in journalistic enterprise Australasia beats the record,
having, in proportion to population, more newspapers than any other country in
the world. An astonishing fact.</p>

<p class="normal">Two circumstances must be mentioned which bear upon our story.
The first is that Basil's surname was not known; he called himself Basil, and
was so called. The second is that in the column of the <i>Princetown Argus</i>
in which births, marriages, and deaths were advertised, there was recorded the
birth and death of a baby, the child of the editor and his wife, born one day
and dying the next. This was the first birth and burial in Princetown. The child
left to them, the little girl of whom we have already spoken, whose name was
Edith, took the loss of her baby sister much to heart, and never a week passed
that she did not visit the churchyard and sit by the tiny grave.</p>

<p class="normal">At the end of twelve months or so there came to Princetown a
preacher of extraordinary power. He was rough, he was uncultivated, he had not
been educated for the pulpit, but he could stir the masses and wake up sleeping
souls. He had a marvellous magnetism and tremendous earnestness, which silenced
the scoffer and made the sinner tremble; the consequence was that sinners and
scoffers went to hear him, and some few were made better by his denunciations.
There are souls which can be reached only through fear. Happily there are more
which can be reached through love.</p>

<p class="normal">Amongst those who were drawn to listen to the preacher was
Basil, and being once present he did not miss a service. One Sabbath the
preacher took sluggishness for his theme which he denounced, in its physical and
moral attributes, as a sin, the consequences of which were not to be avoided.
Men were sent into the world to work, to fulfil duties, and to seek both
assiduously. It was not only sinful, it was cowardly, to put on the armour of
indolence and indifference, and to so intrench oneself was destructive of the
highest qualities of humanity, the exercise of which lifted men above the level
of the beasts of the field. To say, because one is unfortunate, &quot;Oh, what is the
use of striving?&quot; tends to rob life of nobility and heroism. To fight the battle
manfully to the last, to keep one's heart open to humanising influences, however
poor the return which proffered love and sympathy and charity may meet with, is
the work of a man and brings its reward. He has striven, he has proved himself,
he has established his claim to the higher life. To live only for the day, to be
indifferent to the morrow, is a quality by which animals without reason are
distinguished, and, to share with them in this respect is a cowardly and sinful
degradation. &quot;If&quot; (said the preacher) &quot;there are any here who have fallen so
low, I say to them, Arouse yourselves; take down the shutters which darken heart
and soul; admit the light which purifies and sweetens. Be men, not brutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This was the sum of his sermon. Few understood it, but they
did not perhaps value it the less highly on that account. To Basil it came as a
reproach; he quivered under the strokes and left the place of worship with a
beating heart, with tumultuous thoughts in his mind. Scarcely noting whither he
was going he walked towards the churchyard, and there in the distance, sitting
by a grave, he saw a child. It was Edith sitting by the grave of her baby
sister.</p>

<p class="normal">The scene, the attitude, brought Annette's form to his mind.
So used she to sit by her mother's grave on the plantation, and he had
accompanied her and sat by her side. He looked about for flowers; there were
none near; but when he approached Edith he saw that she had some in her lap, and
was weaving them into a garland, as Annette had done in a time really not so
very long ago, but which seemed to belong to another life. She looked up at him,
and the tenderness of her gaze touched him deeply; instantly on her countenance
was reflected the sad wistfulness which dwelt on his. Children are peculiarly
receptive; they meet your smiles with smiles, your sadness with sadness. Edith
just shifted her little body, conveying in the slight movement an invitation to
Basil to sit beside her. He instantly took his place close to her, and they fell
naturally into conversation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is your name, little one?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Edith. Tell me yours. I like you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My name is Basil.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I like that, too. Here is a flower for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where did you gather them, Edith?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We have a garden. Father says it puts him in mind of home.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who is your father?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't you know? Everybody else does. He's the editor of the
<i>Princetown Argus</i>. You know that, don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. And you have a mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes. She is very clever.&quot; Basil nodded. &quot;Father says she
is the cleverest woman in the world. She can make clothes, she can cook, she
knows all about flowers, she can write paragraphs for the paper, and when they
are written she can print them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is a great deal for your mother to do. Does she really
help to print the newspaper?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not now. She did when we first came here. But father has a
great many gentlemen printers in the office, and they do all that. These are
English flowers. The seeds come all the way from England where I was born; but I
don't remember it because I was only a little baby when we came over in a great
big ship. I don't remember the ship either, but I know all about it because
mother has told me about the great storm, and how we were nearly wrecked, and
how the ship was battered to pieces almost.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The English flowers put your father in mind of home. That is
England?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, that is England. When we're very rich we're going back
there. Do you know where it is?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I come from England.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is nice. Like us. Are you going back?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why? Because you don't know?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is the reason, perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You see,&quot; said Edith, arranging some flowers on the grave in
the shape of a cross, &quot;there are so many people there we love. Two grandfathers,
two grandmothers, and such a lot of cousins I've never seen. England must be
very, very beautiful. Father and mother call it home, and when I write I always
say, 'We are coming home one day.' We're going to have a fig-tree; father says
we shall sit under it.&quot; Basil smiled. &quot;I like you to smile; you don't look so
unhappy then. What makes you unhappy? You mustn't be. You must go home with us
and see the people you love.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Suppose there are none, little Edith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She gazed at him solemnly. &quot;Not even an angel?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An angel!&quot; he exclaimed somewhat startled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, an angel. One was here once.&quot; She had completed the
cross of flowers, and she pointed to the grave. &quot;Only for a little while, and
when we go home she is coming with us. She came from heaven to us just for one
night only; I was asleep and didn't see her; I was so sorry. Then they brought
her here, and she flew straight up to heaven. I can't go up there to give her
the English flowers, so I lay them here where she can see them, and when I come
again and the flowers are gone I know that she has taken them away and put them
in a jug of water--up there. Mother says flowers never die in heaven, so baby
sister must have a lot. I dream of her sometimes; I wish you could see her as I
do. There's a picture of a baby angel over my bed, and she is just like that.
Such beautiful large grey eyes--my eyes are grey--and shining wings. We love
each other dearly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope that will always be, little Edith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, it will be. When you love once you love always; that is
what mother says, and she never says anything wrong. I wish you had an angel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I had one once.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, then you have one now. Once means always. Was she a
little girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Like our angel. I am glad. Now you must come and see mother
and father.&quot; She rose and took his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They do not know me, Edith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But <i>I</i> know you, and you know me. You must come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I will come. May I take one flower from your cross?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He selected one and kissed it, and they walked together side
by side. The preacher had said, &quot;Take down the shutters which darken heart and
soul; admit the light which purifies and sweetens.&quot; It was done, and the light
was shining in Basil's heart. He clung to the little hand which was clasped in
his. In that good hour it was indeed a Divine link which re-united him once more
to what was best and noblest. The shadows were dying away. Dark days were before
him, strange experiences were to be his, but in the darkest day of the future a
star was always to shine. &quot;Annette, Annette, Annette,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I will
make an endeavour to see you. I will never again lose faith. A weight has gone
from my heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me kiss the flower where you kissed it,&quot; said Edith.</p>

<p class="normal">He put it to her lips, and she kissed it, and raised her face
innocently. He stooped and kissed her lips.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think,&quot; said Edith contemplatively, &quot;I like you better than
any one else except mother and father and baby angel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The office of the <i>Princetown Argus</i> was now an extensive
building all on one floor; architects had not yet reached higher flights. The
door from the street opened midway between two rooms, the one to the right being
that in which advertisements and orders for subscriptions were taken, the one to
the left being used for book-keeper, editor, and reporters indiscriminately. The
reporting staff did a great part of their work standing; there were only a desk
and a stool for the book-keeper, who assisted in the reading of proofs, and a
table and two chairs for the accommodation of the editor and sub-editor.
Adjoining these two rooms in the rear was the composing-room of the newspaper,
in the rear of that the jobbing-room, in the rear of that the press room. The
living apartments of the editor and his little family were quite at the end of
the building, and were really commodious--sitting-room, kitchen, and two
sleeping-rooms, one for little Edith, the other for her parents. In the
sitting-room there was a piano upon which every member of the family could play
with one finger, there were framed chromos on the walls, and sufficient
accommodation in the shape of chairs and tables. The mantelpiece was embellished
with an extensive array of photographs of grandfathers, grandmothers, uncles,
aunts, and cousins; and the floor was covered with red baize. Taking it
altogether it was an elegant abode for a new goldfield, and Edith's garden, upon
which the window of her bedroom looked out, imparted to it an air of refinement
and sweetness exceedingly pleasant to contemplate. When Edith, still holding
Basil's hand, passed through the business rooms and entered the sitting-room,
the happy editor and proprietor was alone, his wife being busy in the kitchen
getting dinner ready. Domestic servants were the rarest of birds in Princetown;
indeed there were none in the private establishments, for as soon as a girl or
woman made her appearance in the township there was a &quot;rush&quot; for her, and before
she had been there a week she had at least a dozen offers of marriage. A single
woman was worth her weight in gold--Princetown was a veritable paradise for
spinsters of any age, from fifteen to fifty. Small wonder that they turned up
their noses at domestic service, when by merely crooking their little finger
they could become their own mistress, picking and choosing from a host of
amorous gold diggers. Free and easy was the wedding; the eating and drinking,
the popping of corks, the drive through the principal streets, the
indiscriminate invitations to all, the dancing at night, with more popping of
corks and the cracking of revolvers in the open air to proclaim to the world
that an &quot;event&quot; of supreme importance was being celebrated--all tended to show
the value of woman as a marketable commodity. Two or three miles away, in a
gully upon a hill, was the canvas tent to which the bridegroom bore his bride an
hour or two this or that side of midnight, literally bore her often because of
the open shafts which dotted the road; and there the married life commenced. It
is a lame metaphor to say that woman ruled the roast; she ruled everything, and
was bowed down to and worshipped as woman never was before in the history of the
world.</p>

<p class="normal">The editor looked up as his little daughter and Basil entered,
and Edith immediately took upon herself the office of mistress of the
ceremonies.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is Basil, father.&quot; The editor nodded. &quot;He is going to
spend the whole day with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is welcome,&quot; said the editor, who knew Basil by sight.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil smilingly explained that little Edith had taken entire
possession, and was responsible for his intrusion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But you are not intruding,&quot; said the editor. &quot;We shall be
very pleased of your company. Our hive is ruled by a positive Queen Bee, and
there she stands&quot;--with an affectionate look at his daughter, who accepted her
title with amusing gravity--&quot;so that we cannot exactly help ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His tone was exceedingly cordial, and Basil, being heartily
welcomed by Edith's mother, soon made himself at home. The young man's manners
were very winning and afforded pleasure to Edith's parents, who had not, at
least on the goldfields, met with a guest of so much culture and refinement.
Regarding Basil as her special property, Edith pretty well monopolised his
attention in the intervals between meals, but sufficient of Basil's character
was revealed to the editor to set him thinking. He saw that he was entertaining
a gentleman and a man of attainments, and he felt how valuable such an assistant
would be on the editorial staff of his newspaper. The journalists in his employ
had sprung out of the rough elements of colonial life, and although they were
fairly capable men, they lacked the polish which Basil possessed. The result of
his reflections was that before the day was out he made Basil a business
proposition.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It occurs to me,&quot; said the shrewd fellow, &quot;that you are not
exactly cut out for a digger's life.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am afraid you are right,&quot; said Basil, with a smile in which
a touch of sadness might be detected.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why not try something else?&quot; asked the editor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is difficult to know what,&quot; replied Basil; &quot;there are so
few things for which I am fitted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is one in which you would make your mark.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;May I know what it is? I may differ from you; but it would be
a pleasant hearing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sub-editor of the <i>Princetown Argus</i>, for instance,&quot;
suggested the editor, coming straight to the point. He was not the kind of man
to take two bites at a cherry.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil looked him in the face; the proposition startled and
gratified him. &quot;You rush at a conclusion somewhat hastily,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all. I know what I am talking about. You are cut out
for just that position.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have never done anything in the literary way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll take the risk,&quot; said the editor. &quot;A man may go
floundering about all his life without falling into his proper groove. You are
not bound to any other engagement in Princetown?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To none. I am quite free.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you can commence at once?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you are serious.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was never more so. It might be agreeable to you to take up
your quarters with us. In two days I will have a sleeping apartment built for
you, adjoining our little bit of garden. You are a sociable man and a gentleman,
and we should be glad to have you at our table. From your conversation I should
say you have had a classical education. Am I right?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite right; but I am not a very bright scholar. You must not
expect great things.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I expect what you are able to supply; you haven't half enough
confidence in yourself. Why, if I had your advantages--but never mind, I haven't
done badly with my small stock of brains. We'll wake them up.&quot; He rubbed his
hands. &quot;You will be a bit strange at first, but I'll put you in the way of
things. I look upon it as settled.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Would it not be prudent,&quot; said Basil, &quot;for you to take a
little time for consideration?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not an hour; not a minute. Strike while the iron's hot. My
dear sir, this is a go-ahead country. Shake hands on the bargain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They shook hands upon it, and immediately afterwards the
editor regarded Basil with a thoughtful air, and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You puzzle me, you do not ask anything about terms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am content to leave them to you. Wait till you see whether
I am worth anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, the risk is mine, as I have said. Will six pounds a week
and board and lodging suit you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is too much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will be satisfied with it for the first month?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;More than satisfied.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is arranged, then. If we continue together you shall have
an advance at the end of the month, and I shall bind you down not to leave me
without a month's notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On my part, I will be so bound. You are free to discharge me
without notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be the same to both of us. As you are to commence
to-morrow you might think of a subject for a 'leader' in Tuesday's paper. By
Wednesday your bedroom will be ready, and you can live with us as long as you
are on the staff. We shall have reason to congratulate ourselves on the
arrangement we have made.&quot;</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_26" href="#div1Ref_26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Certainly neither Basil nor his employer had reason to be
otherwise. It led to important results in Basil's career, and in years to come
he often thought of the child, the chance meeting with whom in the churchyard
conducted him, by both straight and devious paths, to a goal which he had not
dared to hope he would ever reach. Between him and Edith loving links were soon
firmly forged which time was never to sever. This sweet and human bond was of
inestimable value to Basil; it raised him from the slough of despond into which
he had sunk; the hand of a little child lifted him to a man's height. He was
profoundly grateful; he had now a happy home, he had congenial work to do. The
doubts he had entertained of his fitness for the position were dispelled in a
very short time. He threw himself with ardour and animation into his new duties,
which he performed in a manner that more than justified the confidence reposed
in him. Nominally sub-editor, but really editor of the paper, he infused into
its columns a spirit of intelligence which made it more popular than ever. It
was talked of as an example of what a newspaper should be, and Basil's opinions
upon colonial matters were quoted in the more influential journals in the
colonies as those of a man of far-seeing judgment. A classical allusion now and
then added to the value of Basil's writings, and all Princetown was proud of him
because of the vicarious distinction conferred, through him, upon its
inhabitants. &quot;A clever fellow that,&quot; said John Jones, of the Only Beehive,
appreciating Basil the more because of his own utter ignorance of the classics.
There was a talk of Basil's representing the division in the Legislative
Assembly, but he promptly set that aside by emphatically declaring that he had
no desire for public life or parliamentary honours. Thus six months passed by,
when a revelation was made to him which caused him to carry out a resolve
deplored by all Princetown.</p>

<p class="normal">The official quarters of the township, where public business
was transacted, was known as the Government Camp. In this camp, which was laid
out upon the slope of a hill, were situated the Magistrate's Court, the
buildings in which the mounted troopers lodged, where the gold escort was made
up, where miners' disputes were adjusted, and where miners paid their yearly
sovereign for miners' rights, which gave lawful sanction to their delving for
the precious metal and appropriating the treasure they extracted from the soil.
There were swells in the Government Camp, members of good families in the old
country, for whom something in the shape of official employment had to be found.
It is pleasant to be able to record that there were few sinecures among these
employments, most of the holders having to do something in the shape of work for
their salaries. It was when Basil had served on the staff of the <i>Princetown
Argus</i> for a space of six months, and had saved during that period a matter
of two hundred pounds, that a new Goldfields' Warden made his appearance at the
Government Camp. The name of this gentleman was Majoribanks, and when we
presently part with him he will play no further part in our story; but it will
be seen that the small rle he fills in it is sufficiently pregnant.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Majoribanks was &quot;a new chum&quot; in the colony. Arriving in
the capital with high credentials, the influence of his connections provided him
almost immediately with a berth to which a good salary, with pickings, was
attached. The position of Goldfields' Warden on Princetown was vacant, and he
was appointed to it. His special fitness for the office need not here be
discussed. Many members of good families in England, whose wild ways rendered
desirable their removal to another sphere, developed faculties in Australia
which elevated them into respectable members of society, which they certainly
would not have been had they remained in the old world, surrounded by
temptations. Mr. Majoribanks was not a bad fellow at bottom, and it was a
fortunate day for him and his family when they exchanged farewell greetings.</p>

<p class="normal">There were not many gentlemen--in Mr. Majoribanks'
understanding of the term--in Princetown, and when the new Goldfields' Warden
came in contact with Basil, he recognised the superior metal in the hero of our
story. The casual acquaintance they formed ripened into intimacy, and they met
often in Mr. Majoribanks' quarters and passed many a pleasant hour together.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come and have a smoke this evening,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks to
Basil one Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p class="normal">Saturday was the only day in the week which Basil could call
his own, and he was glad of the invitation and accepted it. Mr. Majoribanks knew
Basil only, as others knew him, by the name of Basil and had not taken the
trouble to inquire whether it was a surname. So the two gentlemen sat in Mr.
Majoribanks' snug quarters on this particular Saturday, and discussed a dainty
little meal, cooked in capital style by the Goldfields' Warden's Chinese cook.
The meal finished, they adjourned to the verandah, and lit their cigars.</p>

<p class="normal">They had much in common; they had travelled over familiar
country in Europe and they compared notes, recalling experiences of old times
which in their likeness to each other drew them closer together.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Upon my soul,&quot; remarked Mr. Majoribanks, &quot;it is an
exceedingly pleasant thing to find one's self in the company of a gentleman. It
makes banishment endurable. Do you ever think of returning to England?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One day, perhaps,&quot; replied Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope we shall meet there,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks. &quot;Is it
allowable to ask what brought you out to the goldfields?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I lost my fortune,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and not knowing what to turn
my hand to came to Australia to make another.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it again allowable to ask whether you have succeeded?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not succeeded.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you had been a bricklayer or a navvy in England you might
tell a different tale.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is not unlikely.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A gentleman stands but little chance here,&quot; observed Mr.
Majoribanks. &quot;We are treated in the colonies to a complete reversal of the
proper order of things. I suppose in the course of time Australia will cut
itself away from the old country and become republic.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is certainly on the cards, but it will be a long time
before that occurs; there are so many different interests, you see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A jumble of odd elements,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When there is a real Australian population,&quot; said Basil, &quot;men
and women born and living here, with no reminiscences of what is now called
'home,' then the movement of absolute self-government will take serious form.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, well, I don't believe in the self-made man. I stick to
the old order.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Individual opinion will not change the current of natural
changes. It is not to be expected that this vast continent will be for ever
satisfied to remain a dependency of a kingdom so many thousands of miles away.
The talk about federation may satisfy for a time, but it is merely a sop in the
pan. By-and-by will come the larger question of a nation with an autonomous
constitution like the United States. Children cut themselves from their mother's
apron strings: so it will be with these colonies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have made a study of such matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To some extent. My position on our local paper has sent me in
that direction.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You like your position?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tolerably well. I cannot say I am wedded to it, but I must
not be ungrateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then the conversation drifted into channels more personal. Mr.
Majoribanks launched into a recital of certain experiences in England and the
Continent, and mourned the break in a career more congenial to him than that of
Goldfields' Warden in Princetown, which he declared to be confoundedly dull and
uninteresting. He missed his theatres, his club, his race meetings, his
fashionable society, and many a sigh escaped him as he dwelt upon these
fascinating themes. Then occurred a pause, and some sudden reminiscence, as yet
untouched, caused him to regard his companion with more than ordinary curiosity.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An odd idea strikes me,&quot; he said. &quot;Have you a twin brother?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; replied Basil, smiling. &quot;What makes you ask?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, of course that is not likely,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks. &quot;If
you had a twin brother his name would not be Basil. It is singular for all that.
But it is a most extraordinary likeness. A cousin of yours perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I haven't the slightest idea of your meaning. I have no
cousins that I am aware of.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It has only just struck me. As I looked at you a moment ago I
saw the wonderful resemblance between you and a man I met in Paris. Basil is not
a very common name.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not very. Had the gentleman you met in Paris another tacked
to it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks. &quot;Whittingham.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whittingham!&quot; exclaimed Basil, greatly startled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil Whittingham--that is the gentleman's full name; and, by
the way, I was told, I remember, that he had been in Australia, gold-digging. It
is a curious story--but you seem excited.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With good cause,&quot; said Basil. &quot;My name is Basil Whittingham.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You don't say so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, that makes it all the stranger.&quot; Basil rose and paced
the verandah in uncontrollable excitement. The full significance of this
extraordinary revelation did not immediately dawn upon him, and at present he
did not connect Newman Chaytor with it. Out of the chaos of thought which
stirred his mind he evoked nothing intelligible. Mr. Majoribanks' eyes followed
him as he paced to and fro, and fixed themselves frankly upon him when he paused
and faced him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were you aware that my name is Whittingham?&quot; asked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Upon my honour, no,&quot; replied Mr. Majoribanks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is some mystery here,&quot; said Basil, mastering his
excitement, &quot;which it seems imperative should be solved. As you remarked, Basil
is not a common name; neither is Whittingham; and that the two should be
associated in the person of a man who bears so wonderful a resemblance to me
that you would have taken us to be twin brothers, makes it all the more
mysterious and inexplicable. You are not joking with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As I am a gentleman, I have told you nothing but the truth.
There are such things as coincidences, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes; but if this is one, it is the strangest I have ever
heard of.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It has all the appearance of it,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks,
thoughtfully. &quot;Within my knowledge there are only two men bearing the name of
Whittingham--one, myself, the other an uncle in England, with whom,
unfortunately, I had some differences of opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks, &quot;the coincidences continue. The
gentleman I refer to had an uncle of the name of Whittingham with whom he also
had some differences of opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Had</i> an uncle?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who is dead,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My uncle was a gentleman of fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So was his.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was to have been his heir. I displeased him and he
disinherited me. That was really the reason why I left England for Australia.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Majoribanks fell back in his chair, and said, &quot;You take my
breath away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why? Because that is the sum total of the story which I said
just now was so curious. Mr. Whittingham, there must be something more than
coincidence in all this.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oblige me a moment. Let me think.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He turned his back upon Mr. Majoribanks, and steadied himself.
By a determined effort he subdued the chaos of thought by which he was agitated.
The form of Newman Chaytor rose before him. Was it possible that this man, in
whom he had placed implicit trust, who knew the whole story of his life, who had
deserted him and left him for dead without taking the trouble to assure himself
that his fall down the shaft was fatal--was it possible that this man had played
him false? It seemed scarcely credible, but what other construction was to be
placed upon the story which Mr. Majoribanks had revealed to him. He paused again
before his companion, and said in his most earnest tone:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Majoribanks, a vital issue hangs upon the information you
have given me. I am sure you will not trifle with me. You are a gentleman, and
your word is not to be doubted. Were you intimately acquainted with this double,
who bears my name, who so strangely resembles me, and whose story is so similar
to my own?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was no intimacy whatever,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks. &quot;I saw
him once, and once only, in Paris, and we passed an evening together. When I
parted from him--a party of us went to the Comdie Franaise that night to see
Bernhardt--I saw him no more. The way of it was this. It being resolved in
solemn family council that I was to retrieve my battered fortunes in the Sahara,
I paid a last visit to dear delightful Paris to bid it a long adieu. A friend
accompanied me, and a friend of his to whom he was under an obligation--to speak
plainly, a money-lender--happening to be in Paris at the same time, we chummed
together. We dined at the Grand, and there, at another table, sat your
prototype. Our money-lending friend, who knows everything and everybody, pointed
him out to us, and told us his story. His name was Basil Whittingham; he had
been in Australia, gold-digging; he had a wealthy uncle of the same surname whom
he had offended, and who had driven him out of his native land, with an
intimation that he was to consider himself disinherited. Upon his death-bed,
however, the old gentleman's hard heart softened, and he made a will by which
the discarded nephew was restored to his good graces, and became heir to all he
possessed. The fortune which fell to your lucky double was not in land and
houses; it was in something better, hard cash, and it amounted, so far as I can
recollect, to not less than between fifty and sixty thousand pounds. Whereupon
the lucky heir winged his way homeward, by which time his uncle had joined the
majority, and took possession of his windfall. Our money-lending friend had some
slight acquaintance with the heir, and we were introduced. It was a night I had
occasion to remember, quite apart from any connection you may have with the
story. Do you adhere to it that it resembles yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Up to the day upon which I left England it agrees with it
entirely. As to what subsequently occurred I knew nothing until this moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, all that I can say--without understanding in the least,
mind you, how it could have come about--is, that I would look into it, if I were
in your place.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be looked into. Do you remember if the uncle's
christian name was mentioned?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot quite say. Refresh my memory; it may have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bartholomew.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Upon my word, now you mention it, I think Bartholomew was
mentioned. Another uncommon name.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have occasion to remember that night, you said, apart
from me. May I inquire in what way?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, when we left the theatre, we adjourned to a private
room in the Grand, and there we had a little flutter. Baccarat was the game, and
I was cleaned out. Upon my honour, I think I was the most unfortunate beggar
under the sun. I give you my word that I hadn't enough left to pay my hotel
bill, which was the last legacy I left my honoured father.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your money-lending friend won the money, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He won a bit, but the spoil fell principally to an elderly
gentleman of the name of--of--of--now what <i>was</i> the fellow's name? It
wasn't English, nor was he an Englishman. Ah. I have it. Bidaud--yes, Bidaud.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil's face turned white; there was no longer room for doubt
that foul treachery had been done. It was Newman Chaytor who had plotted and
planned for his destruction. This he might have borne, and the white heat of his
anger might have grown cold with time. But Anthony Bidaud's introduction into
the bad scheme included also Annette, a possible victim in the treachery. That
she should become the prey of these villains, and that he should allow her life
to be ruined, her happiness to be blasted, without an effort to save her, was
not to be thought of. The scales fell from his eyes, and he saw Newman Chaytor
in his true light. By what crooked paths the end had been reached he could not,
in the excitement of the moment, determine. That would have to be thought out
presently; meanwhile his resolution was taken. To remain inactive would be the
work of a coward.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know the name of Bidaud?&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know it well,&quot; said Basil. &quot;Did this M. Bidaud accompany
you to the theatre on that night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He and this namesake of mine were companions, I take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Something more than companions, to all appearances. Close
friends rather.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did they appear to be on good terms with each other?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On the best of terms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope,&quot; said Basil, &quot;you will excuse me for questioning you
so closely, but this is a matter that very deeply affects me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Mr. Majoribanks, &quot;you are heartily
welcome to every scrap of information I can give that will throw light upon this
most mysterious piece of business. It is altogether the strangest thing I ever
heard. I'll not ask you who the other fellow is, but I have a faint idea that he
must be the most unmitigated scoundrel on the face of the earth. Tell me as much
or as little as you please, and in the meantime fire away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My namesake was dining at the Grand Hotel when you first saw
him. Was M. Bidaud in his company?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was; they were dining together at a separate table.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were any ladies with them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll not pledge myself. So far as I can recollect, there was
no one else at the table.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you hear talk of any ladies of their acquaintance?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think not. Stop, though. I fancy there was an allusion to a
pretty niece.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Annette lives,&quot; thought Basil, and said aloud, &quot;An allusion
made by M. Bidaud to my namesake?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who suggested the adjournment to a private room after the
theatre?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The invitation was given by M. Bidaud, and we accepted it. I
was always ready for that kind of thing--too ready, my people say. So off we
went, and played till daylight, with the aforesaid result.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were M. Bidaud and my namesake living permanently in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I fancy not; something was said of their travelling about for
pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One more question,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and I have done. There was
an allusion to a pretty niece. Are you aware whether the young lady was
travelling with her uncle?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am not, and I do not remember what the allusion was. I
think I have completely emptied my budget.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank you sincerely; you have rendered me an inestimable
service. I have no wish to have my affairs talked about, and you will add to the
obligation if you will consider this conversation confidential.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Certainly, my dear fellow, as you desire it. It is entirely
between ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They parted shortly afterwards, and Basil, plunged in thought,
returned to the township. The first step he took was to consult the file of the <i>
Princetown Argus</i> for a record of the accident in which he had so nearly lost
his life. He had heard that its earliest numbers contained accounts of his
discovery and rescue, but he had not hitherto had the curiosity to hunt them up
and read them. It was now imperative that he should make himself acquainted with
every particular of the affair. He found without difficulty what he sought, and
as he read through the reports of his condition which were published from day to
day he dwelt upon portions which a year ago he would have considered monstrous
inventions or exaggerations. Thus: &quot;There is a certain element of mystery in the
affair, and we shall briefly allude to one or two points which seem to have a
bearing upon it.&quot; Again: &quot;Inferring that there were two men working the shaft,
is it possible, when the accident occurred, that the man at the top of the shaft
made tracks from the place and left his mate to a cruel and lingering death?&quot;
The inference here sought to be established was not to be mistaken--to wit, that
Newman Chaytor had purposely left him to a cruel and lingering death. And still
more significant: &quot;An opinion has been expressed that the rope has been tampered
with, and that it did not break from natural wear and tear.&quot; Given that the
peril into which he had been plunged was the result of design, there was more
than a seeming confirmation of the opinion that the rope had been tampered with.
Basil, being now engaged upon a full consideration of the circumstances,
remembered that the rope to all appearance was perfectly sound. That being so,
it was Chaytor's deliberate intention to murder him by weakening the strands.
When suspicion enters the mind of a man who has trusted and been deceived, it is
hard to dislodge it; small incidents and spoken words to which no importance was
attached at the time they were uttered, present themselves and gather force
until they assume a dark significance. When Basil laid aside the file of
newspapers he had arrived at the conclusion that Chaytor had deliberately
schemed for the fatal end which had been averted by the merest accident. Old
Corrie's warnings and distrust of Chaytor came to his mind. &quot;Corrie was right,&quot;
thought Basil; &quot;he read this man better than I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But clear as Chaytor's villainy had appeared to be, there was
much that Basil was unable to comprehend. In what way had Chaytor discovered
that Basil's uncle had repented of his determination to disinherit his nephew?
How and by what means had it come to the villain's knowledge? Upon these and
other matters Basil had yet to be enlightened.</p>

<p class="normal">He continued his mental search. Chaytor, returning to England,
had succeeded in obtaining possession of his inheritance; and--what was of still
greater weight to Basil--he had succeeded in introducing himself to Anthony
Bidaud as the man he represented himself to be. &quot;There was an allusion to a
pretty niece.&quot; Then Chaytor was with Annette, playing Basil's part. Was it
likely that Annette would be deceived. Years had passed since they had met, and
the woman might have reason to doubt her childhood's memories. A cunning
plausible villain this Newman Chaytor. Successful in imposing upon Annette, in
wooing and perhaps winning her--Basil groaned at the thought--what a future was
before her! There was a clear duty before him. To go to England with as little
delay as possible, and unmask the plot.</p>

<p class="normal">That night he counted the money he had saved; it amounted to
two hundred and thirty pounds. He could land in the old country with a hundred
and fifty pounds. He consulted the exchange newspapers sent to the office. In
seventeen days a steamer would start from Sydney for England. By that vessel he
would take his departure.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_27" href="#div1Ref_27">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">The next morning Basil said to the editor, &quot;I fear I am about
to inflict a disappointment upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Wants a rise of salary,&quot; thought the editor. &quot;All right; he
shall have it.&quot; Aloud he said, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wish you to release me from a promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What promise?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When we made the engagement it was understood that I should
not leave you without a month's notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That was so,&quot; said the editor drily; and thought, &quot;He's going
to put the screw upon me that way. I am ready for him; I'll give him all he
asks.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wish to leave without notice.&quot; The editor was silent, and
Basil continued: &quot;I am under great obligations to you; I have been very happy in
your service, and I have done my best to please you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have pleased me thoroughly; I hope I have said nothing to
give you a different impression.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed you have not; no man could have acted fairer by me
than you have done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Soft soap,&quot; thought the editor. &quot;Have I been mistaken in
him?&quot; Aloud: &quot;Well, then, I am sure you will act fairly by me. I cannot release
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must; indeed you must. It is an imperative necessity.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can't see it. Look here. Are you going to start an
opposition paper?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have no intention of doing so. That would be a bad return.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would. Some other fellow, then, is going to start an
opposition, and has made you a tempting offer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are wrong. It is upon purely personal grounds that I
shall have to leave. I am going home.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Home! To England?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To England; and there is vital need for dispatch.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hallo!&quot; thought the editor, &quot;he has come into property. I
knew he was highly connected.&quot; Aloud: &quot;Now don't you be foolish. I am an older
man than you, and therefore, on the face of it, a better judge of things. I
don't expect a rise of salary would tempt you to remain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not if I doubled what you are getting?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not if you were to multiply it by ten.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The editor considered before he spoke again. &quot;Come, here's an
offer for you. I will take you into partnership. You see the value I place upon
your services. I'm dealing fair and square.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You offer me more than I deserve, more than I accept. Nothing
can tempt me to remain. I must leave Princetown; I must leave the colony. I am
called home suddenly and imperatively. You have been a good friend to me;
continue so, I beg, and release me at once. You talk of going home some day
yourself. If all goes well with me we may meet in the old land and renew our
friendship. You know me well enough, I trust, to be convinced that I would not
desire to leave you so abruptly without some strong necessity. If you compel me
to remain----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! you admit that I can compel you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The obligation is binding upon me, and if you insist upon my
giving you a month's notice it must be done, in honour. I cannot break my word.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There speaks the gentleman,&quot; thought the editor, and gazed
with admiration at the pleader. &quot;But you will be doing me,&quot; continued Basil, &quot;an
injury that may be irreparable. The delay may ruin my life, and the life of
another very dear to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am a dunderhead,&quot; thought the editor. &quot;There's a young lady
mixed up in this.&quot; Aloud: &quot;I should be sorry to do that; put you see the fix you
place me in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It grieves me. I beg you to give me back my word.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It comes so sudden. Why did you not tell me before?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because I knew of nothing that called for my hasty departure
until last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is something more than a business aspect of it. We have
grown fond of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have grown fond of you and yours. I shall think of you with
affection.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The editor was softened. &quot;I will think it over, and let you
know in the course of the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is only reasonable,&quot; said Basil, &quot;that you should have
time for consideration.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The subject was dropped. The editor consulted his wife, who
was genuinely sorry at the prospect of losing Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I looked upon him as one of the family,&quot; she said, &quot;and it
will almost break Edith's heart to part with him.&quot; Then, with a woman's shrewd
wit, she added, &quot;Let us try what Edith can do to persuade him out of his
resolution.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Away went Edith half an hour afterwards to seek Basil and
argue with him. She found him in the churchyard, standing by the grave of the
baby angel.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mother says you are going away,&quot; said the child.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, my dear,&quot; said Basil. &quot;I am very, very sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! how I shall miss you,&quot; said Edith, the tears springing to
her eyes. &quot;Won't you stay if I ask you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot, dear child. Dry your eyes. We shall meet again
by-and-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She put her handkerchief to her eyes but her tears flowed
fast, and she sat by the grave and sobbed as if her heart was breaking.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Listen to me, Edith,&quot; said Basil, sitting beside her and
taking her hand. &quot;If baby angel was a long, long way from here, and was in
trouble and cried for you to come to her, would you not go to help her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I would, I would; and they would take me to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am sure they would, for you have good parents my dear. You
told me when I first met you here that I had an angel, and that you were glad.
Edith, my dear, my angel is calling to me to come and help her in her trouble.
Would it not be very wrong for me to say, 'No, I will not come; I do not care
for your trouble?'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would be wicked.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, dear, it would be wicked, and I should not deserve your
love if I acted so. When I first saw her she was a little girl like you; you
reminded me of her, and I loved you because of that, and loved you better
afterwards because of yourself. I shall always love you, Edith; I shall never,
never forget you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She threw her arms round his neck and lay in his embrace,
sobbing more quietly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can do something for me, Edith, that will fix you in my
heart for ever.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can I? Tell me, and I will do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go to your father and say, 'You must let Basil go, father.
His angel is calling for him, and it will be wicked if he does not go quickly.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But that will be sending you away from me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know it will, my dear; but it will be doing what is right.
If I remain I shall be very, very unhappy. You would not like me to be that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no; I want you to be happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Make me so, dear child, by doing as I bid you; and one day
perhaps you will see my angel, and she shall love you as I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">So by artfully affectionate paths he led her to his wish, and
they went back hand in hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well,&quot; said the editor to Basil, later in the day, &quot;you must
have your way. The little plot we laid has failed, and Edith says you must go.
You are a good fellow, and have served me well.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I sincerely thank you. If I apply to you for a character you
will give me one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed I will; the best that man could have. But there are
conditions to my consent. You must stop till Thursday.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you must act as 'Our Special Correspondent' at home. A
letter once a month.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I promise you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have not beaten me entirely, you see,&quot; said the editor
good humouredly, &quot;I shall get something out of you. I am pleased we shall part
good friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They shook hands, and passed a pleasant evening together. The
editor had a motive in stipulating that Basil should remain till Thursday. He
was not going to let such a man leave Princetown without some public recognition
of his merits; and on the following day Basil received an invitation to dine
with the townsmen at the principal hotel on the night before his departure. He
gratefully accepted it; he had worked honestly, and had won his way into the
esteem of the inhabitants of the thriving township.</p>

<p class="normal">It was a famous gathering, and there was not room for all who
applied for tickets. John Jones, of the Only Beehive, took the chair. On his
right sat Basil, on his left, Mr. Majoribanks. The Government Camp was worthily
represented; all the large storekeepers were present, and several of the most
prosperous miners. It was a gala night; the exterior of the hotel was gay with
flags of all nations, and the editor's wife and Edith had stripped their garden
of flowers to decorate the table. The Governor of the colony could scarcely have
been more honoured.</p>

<p class="normal">Of course there were speeches, and of course they were
reported in the
<i>Princetown Argus</i> the next morning. Basil's health was proposed by John
Jones in magniloquent terms, which were cheered to the echo; had Basil's
thoughts not been elsewhere, even in the midst of this festivity, he would have
been greatly amused at the catalogue of virtues with which he was credited by
the chairman, but as it was he could not help being touched by the evident
sincerity of the compliments which were showered upon him. Princetown, said John
Jones, owed Basil a debt which it could never repay. He had elevated public
taste, and had conferred distinction upon the township by his rare literary
gifts. Great was their loss at his departure but they had the gratification of
believing that he would ever look back with affection upon the time he had spent
in &quot;our flourishing township.&quot; And they had the further gratification of knowing
that they had a champion in the great world to which he was returning, and which
he would adorn with his gifts. Before resuming his seat it was his proud task to
give effect to one of the pleasantest incidents in this distinguished gathering.
The moment it was known that Basil was about to leave them a movement was set
afoot to present him with some token of their regard. In the name of the
subscribers, whose names were duly set forth in the illuminated scroll which
accompanied the testimonial, he begged to present to the guest of the evening &quot;a
gold keyless lever watch, half-quarter repeater, dome half hunting case,
three-quarter plate movement, best double roller escapement, compensated and
adjusted, and with all the latest improvements.&quot; John Jones rolled out this
elaborate description as though each item in it were a delicious morsel which
could not be dwelt upon too long. Engraved upon the case was a record of the
presentation, which the orator read amid cheers, and attached to the watch was a
gold chain, with another long description, of which John Jones took care not to
miss a single word. Then came the peroration, in which the chairman excelled
himself, its conclusion being, &quot;I call upon you now to drink, with three times
three, health and prosperity to our honoured guest, a gentleman, scholar, and
good fellow.&quot; He led a hip, hip, hip, hurrah--hoorah--hoorah! And a little one
in (the giant of the lot), &quot;Hoo-o-o-o-rah-h-h-h!&quot; Then they sang, &quot;For he's a
jolly good fellow,&quot; in which they were joined by all the gold-diggers at the bar
and in the High Street outside. John Jones sat down beaming, and gazing around
with broad smiles, wiped his heated forehead, and whispered to himself, &quot;Bravo,
John Jones! Let them beat that if they can!&quot; The presentation of the watch was a
surprise to Basil; the secret had been well kept, and the generous-hearted
donors were rewarded by the short speech which Basil made in response. It was
eloquent and full of feeling, and when he had finished the cheers were renewed
again and again. The watch and chain were really a handsome gift, and before
Basil put them on they were passed round for general inspection. Then a
sentimental song was sung, followed by another toast. (The story-teller must not
omit to mention that the first proposed were loyal toasts, which were received
with the greatest enthusiasm.) Other toasts and other songs followed, the health
of everybody who was anybody being proposed and drunk with acclaim. One of the
most effective speeches of the evening was made by the editor of the Princetown
Ares, in response to the toast of &quot;The Press.&quot; He paid full tribute to Basil,
and said: &quot;He is about to leave us, but we shall not lose him entirely. I take
the greatest pride in announcing that he has accepted the post of special
European correspondent to the <i>Princetown Argus</i>, and we shall look out
eagerly for the polished periods in which he will describe the great events of
the old world. We send a herald forth to represent us, and the mother country
has reason to congratulate herself that our choice has fallen upon such a
gentleman as our guest,&quot; &amp;c., &amp;c. It would occupy too many pages to give a full
report of the proceedings. Those who are curious in such matters cannot do
better than consult the columns of the next morning's issue of the <i>Princetown
Argus</i>, in which the speeches were fully reported, with a complete list of
the names of those present on the notable occasion. The party did not break up
until the small hours, and it is to be feared that some of the jolly fellows,
when they sang &quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; were rather unsteady on their legs. Whether the
occasion furnished any excuse for this sad lapse the present chronicler will not
venture to say. To judge from John Jones, who was not the least of the
offenders, they were little the worse for it, for he was attending to his Only
Beehive, early the following morning as fresh as a lark. But then John Jones was
an exceptional being.</p>

<p class="normal">The hardest parting was with Edith. The child gave Basil a
bunch of flowers and her favourite doll. To refuse the doll would have caused
the little maid fresh sorrow, so Basil accepted the token of affection, and
subsequently, before he left Sydney, sent Edith another, with which she fell
violently in Jove, and christened it Basil, though it was of the female sex.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-bye, my dear,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and God bless you!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Edith's voice was choked with tears, and she could only gaze
mournfully at the friend who had supplied her with loving memories.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Speed you well,&quot; said the editor; &quot;hope we shall meet again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good luck, mate!&quot; was the farewell greeting of a number of
friends; Basil did not know until now that he had so many. He waved his hand to
them, and was gone. But he had not travelled two miles before he heard the sound
of a horse's hoofs galloping after him. He turned and saw Mr. Majoribanks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It just occurred to me,&quot; said the Goldfields' Warden, &quot;that
the name of the money-lender I met in Paris, through whom I became acquainted
with your namesake, might be useful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is very thoughtful of you,&quot; said Basil, &quot;it ought to have
occurred to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know no more about him than I have already told you,&quot; said
Mr. Majoribanks, &quot;and I am not acquainted with his address, but I believe he
lives in London. His name real or assumed--for some of his fraternity trade
under false names--is Edward Kettlewell.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Basil; &quot;I shall remember it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Majoribanks kept with him for another mile, and then
galloped back to the township. The steamer in which Basil took his passage home
started punctually to the hour, and bore Basil from the land in which he had met
with so many sweet and bitter experiences; on the forty-fifth day from that of
his departure he set foot once more in England.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_28" href="#div1Ref_28">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">For cogent reasons Basil had travelled home third-class. It
economised his funds--of which he felt the necessity--and it enabled him the
better to carry out his wish of not making friends on board. The task upon which
he was engaged rendered it advisable that as little curiosity as possible should
be aroused respecting himself and his personal history. That he should have to
work to some extent in secresy was not congenial to his nature, but by so doing
he would have a better chance of success. Until he came face to face with Newman
Chaytor it was as well that his operations should be so conducted as not to put
his treacherous comrade on his guard.</p>

<p class="normal">He had ample time on board ship to review the events of the
past few years, and although he found himself wandering through labyrinths of
extreme perplexity as to the doings of Newman Chaytor, the conclusion was forced
upon him that his false friend had practised towards him a systematic course of
treachery and deceit. He had read accounts of men returning home from distant
lands for the express purpose of personating others to whom they bore some close
personal resemblance, and one famous case presented itself in which such a plot
was only exposed by the wonderful skill of the agents employed to frustrate it.
There, as in his own case, a large fortune hung upon the issue, but Newman
Chaytor had been more successful than the impostor who had schemed to step into
the enjoyment of a great estate. Chaytor had obtained possession of the fortune,
and was now enjoying the fruits of his nefarious plot. But Basil's information
was so imperfect that he was necessarily completely in the dark as to the
precise means by which Newman Chaytor had brought his scheming to this
successful stage. He knew nothing whatever of the correspondence which Chaytor
had carried on with his uncle and Annette. Determined as he was to spare no
efforts to unmask the villain, such a knowledge would have spurred him on with
indignant fierceness. To recover his fortune, if it were possible to do so, was
the lesser incentive; far more important was it, in his estimation, that Annette
should be saved from the snare which had been prepared for her.</p>

<p class="normal">It was with strange sensations that he walked once more
through familiar thoroughfares, and noted that nothing was changed but himself.
Since last he trod them he had learnt some of life's saddest lessons; but hope,
and faith, and love remained to keep his spirit young. It was no light matter
that he had been awakened from the dull lethargy of life into which he had
fallen in the earlier days of Princetown; that his faith in human nature had
been restored; that he had won affection and esteem from strangers who even now,
though the broad seas divided them, had none but kindly thoughts of him. Foul as
was the plot of which he was the victim, he had cause to be deeply grateful.</p>

<p class="normal">He took lodgings on the Lambeth side of Westminster Bridge,
two modest rooms, for which he paid seven shillings a week; food would cost him
little; his modest resources must be carefully husbanded, and he would be
contented with the humblest fare. His task might take long in the
accomplishment, and to find himself stranded in the City of Unrest would be
fatal. His experiences had been so far valuable that they assisted him to a more
comprehensive view of the circumstances of life. When he was in England he had
thought little of the morrow. Now it had to be reckoned with.</p>

<p class="normal">In considering how he should set about his task, he had
decided that it would be advisable to call in professional assistance. He had
not arrived at this decision without long deliberation. He detested the means,
but repugnant as the course was to him he felt that they were justifiable.
Singularly enough he had, without being aware of it, taken lodgings in a house,
the master of which belonged to the class he intended to call to his aid. He
arrived at this knowledge on the second day of his tenancy. Children always
attracted him, and his landlady had four, all of them boys, with puffy cheeks
and chubby limbs. Their ages were three, five, seven, and nine, a piece of
information given to him by their mother as he issued from the house on the
second morning, and stood by her side a moment watching their antics. The word
is not exactly correct, for their pastime was singularly grave and composed. The
eldest boy wielded a policeman's truncheon, and his three brothers, standing in
a line, were obeying the word of command to march, a few steps this way, a few
steps that, to halt, and finally to separate and take up positions in distant
doorways, from which they looked severely at the passers-by.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bless their hearts!&quot; said the proud mother. &quot;They're playing
policemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They seem to know all about it,&quot; remarked Basil &quot;They ought
to,&quot; responded the mother. &quot;It was born in them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is your husband a policeman?&quot; asked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was, sir,&quot; replied the mother; &quot;but he has retired from
the force, and belongs now to a private inquiry.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil thought of this as he walked away, after patting the
children on the head, who did not know exactly whether to be gratified at the
mark of attention, or to straightway take the stranger into custody. He had not
seen his landlord yet, and it had happened, when he engaged the rooms from the
woman, that, with the usual carelessness of persons in her station of life, she
had not asked her new lodger's name, being perfectly satisfied of his
respectability by his paying her a fortnight's rent in advance, and informing
her that he would continue to do so as long as he remained in the house. Basil
was afraid, if he went to a regularly established private office, that the fees
demanded would be higher than his slender resources warranted, and bent as he
was upon economising, he saw here a possible opportunity of obtaining the
assistance he needed at a reduced rate. Therefore on the evening of this day he
tapped at the door of the sitting-room, in which his landlord was playing a game
of &quot;old maid&quot; with three of his children, and intimated his desire for a little
chat with the man after the youngsters had gone to bed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On business,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No time like the present, sir,&quot; said the landlord, who saw
&quot;with half an eye,&quot; as he subsequently expressed himself, that his tenant was a
gentleman: &quot;I'll come up to your room at once, unless you prefer to talk here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We shall be more private up-stairs,&quot; said Basil, and
up-stairs they went to discuss the business.</p>

<p class="normal">As a preliminary the landlord handed Basil a card, with &quot;Mr.
Philpott,&quot; printed on it, and in a corner, &quot;Private Inquiry,&quot; to which was added
the address of the house in which they were sitting.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you carry on your business here, then?&quot; inquired Basil.
&quot;Partly, sir,&quot; replied Mr. Philpott. &quot;I am engaged at an office in Surrey
Street, but it is seldom that my time is fully occupied there, and as I am not
on full pay I stipulate that I shall be free to undertake any little bit of
business that may fall into my hands in a private way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That may suit me,&quot; said Basil. &quot;To be frank with you, I was
looking out for some one who would do what I want at a reasonable rate; I am not
overburdened with funds, but I can afford to pay moderate fees. Will that meet
your views?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir. If you will tell me what you want done I will let
you know about how much it will cost.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil paused before he commenced; he was dealing with a
stranger, and he did not wish to disclose his name.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What passes between us is in confidence, Mr. Philpott?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Altogether in confidence, sir. That is one of the rules of
our profession. Whether anything comes of it or not, I shall say nothing of my
client to a third party, unless you instruct me otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are sometimes consulted by people who desire to conceal
their names?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes, but they are not generally so frank as you are. You
would rather not tell me your name?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is my desire, if it will make no difference.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not an atom of difference. Say Mr. Smith.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am obliged to you. I need not, then, disclose my own
particular interest in the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all, if it will not hamper me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't see how it will hamper you in the least. Shall I pay
you a modest retainer? Will a guinea do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A guinea will do, sir. Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You had better take notes of what I say, Mr. Philpott.&quot; The
private inquiry agent produced his pocket-book. &quot;Write down first the names I
give you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Philpot took down the names and addresses of Mr.
Bartholomew Whittingham and of the lawyers in London who transacted that
gentleman's affairs when Basil was last in England; also the name of Mr. Basil
Whittingham.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Any address to this name, sir?&quot; asked Mr. Philpott.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None. Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham is, or was--for I
understand he is dead--a gentleman of considerable fortune; Mr. Basil
Whittingham is his nephew; the lawyers whose names I have given you transacted
the old gentleman's business for many years, but I am not aware whether they
have continued to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is easily ascertained.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham had neither wife nor children,
and some years since it was his intention to leave all his property to his
nephew. The young man, however, offended his uncle, and the old gentleman
thereupon informed his nephew that he had destroyed the will he had made in his
favour, and that Mr. Basil Whittingham might consider himself disinherited. Do
you understand it thus far?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is perfectly clear, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The relations between the uncle and his nephew were
completely broken off. Mr. Basil Whittingham--who had some private fortune of
his own, but had got rid of it--being disappointed in his expectations, left
England for Australia, where he resided for a considerable time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For how many years shall we say, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Five or six. When he was near his end the uncle relented of
his decision, and made another will--I am supposing that he really destroyed the
first, which may or may not have been the case--by which his original intention
was carried out, and his nephew was constituted sole heir to the property.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This property, I believe, was not in real estate, but in cash
and securities which were easily convertible. The knowledge of his kindness
reached the nephew's ears in Australia, and he returned home and took possession
of the fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very natural.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wish these details to be verified, or otherwise, Mr.
Philpott.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I undertake to do so, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wish also to ascertain where Mr. Basil Whittingham is now
residing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can you give a clue, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A very slight one, I am afraid. The last I heard of the
nephew was that about eighteen months ago he was in Paris, in the company of a
Mr. Edward Kettlewell, a money-lender, whose offices are, or were, in London. I
am under the impression that Mr. Basil Whittingham and Mr. Kettlewell may have
had some business transactions with each other. If so, it should not be
difficult to trace Mr. Basil Whittingham through Mr. Kettlewell.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It may I be more difficult than you imagine,&quot; said Mr.
Philpott. &quot;These money-lenders are difficult persons to deal with. They are as
jealous of their clients as a cat of her kittens. 'Hands off,' they cry; 'this
is my bird.' Hold hard a minute, sir. I have this year's 'London Directory,'
downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He left the room, and returned bearing the bulky volume, which
he proceeded to consult. No Mr. Edward Kettlewell, money-lender or financial
agent, was to be found in its pages. There were plenty of Kettlewells, and a few
Edwards among them but not one who dealt in money.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, &quot;it may be one of these. He may
have retired, he may have left the country, he may be dead. I will look through
the directories for a few years past, and we will see if we can find him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My information concerning him,&quot; said Basil, &quot;is not very
exact, and may after all be incorrect; but with or without his assistance it is
most important that the address of Mr. Basil Whittingham should be ascertained.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do my best, sir; no man can do more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is another matter, of which I must beg you not to lose
sight. Shortly after Mr. Basil Whittingham arrived in Australia he came in
contact with a gentleman, M. Anthony Bidaud, who owned a plantation in
Queensland. This gentleman had a daughter, quite a child then, whose name is
Annette. M. Anthony Bidaud died suddenly, and left no will. On the morning of
his death a brother and sister--the brother's name, Gilbert--presented
themselves at the plantation, and the brother administered the estate, and
assumed the guardianship of his niece. The plantation was sold, and the little
girl, with her uncle and aunt, came to Europe. Between the child and Mr. Basil
Whittingham there existed a bond of affection, and since his return to England
he has succeeded--so my information goes--in establishing friendly relations
with M. Gilbert Bidaud. If you are fortunate enough to trace Mr. Basil
Whittingham, my impression is that the knowledge will lead you straight to M.
Gilbert Bidaud and his sister and niece, to discover whom I consider of far
greater importance than the young man. Now, Mr. Philpott, if you have grasped
the situation, are you prepared to set to work?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not lose a day, sir; I commence my inquiries
to-morrow; and as you inform me that you are not exactly rich it may be
convenient if I present a weekly account, including all charges to date, so that
you may know how you stand as to expenses. Then you can go on or stop at your
pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will be the best plan,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Philpott was very much puzzled that night when he thought
over the commission entrusted to him. &quot;He says nothing of himself,&quot; thought the
private inquiry agent, &quot;nor of the particular interest he has in the matter--a
very particular interest, for I never saw any one more in earnest than he is.
His voice absolutely trembled when he spoke of the uncle and Mdlle. Annette. Now
that would not happen if he were acting as an agent for another person. What is
the conclusion, then? That he is acting for himself. Does this Mr. Basil
Whittingham owe him money? Perhaps. And yet it does not strike me as an affair
of that kind. Well, at all events, he has acted openly and straightforwardly
with me so far as he and I are concerned. It is not often a client tells you
that he is living under an assumed name. I must ask the wife if his shirts and
handkerchiefs are marked.&quot; His curiosity, however, was destined not to be
appeased; his wife told him that Basil's clothing bore no initials--which,
according to Mr. Philpott's way of thinking, betokened extreme caution, and
whetted his curiosity. He did not, however, allow this to interfere with the
zealous exercise of his duties. Proceeding step by step he presented his weekly
reports to Basil. In the course of a short time Basil's worst suspicions were
confirmed. Newman Chaytor had come home and, representing himself to be Basil
Whittingham, had experienced no difficulty in establishing his position and
administering his uncle's estate. This done, he had disappeared, and Mr.
Philpott was unsuccessful in tracing him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But,&quot; said Basil, &quot;would not a man, arriving from a country
so distant as Australia, in such circumstances have to prove his identity?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Philpott opened his eyes at this question; to use his own
term, he &quot;smelt a rat.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Certainly he would,&quot; replied Mr. Philpott. &quot;But that was
simple enough in Mr. Basil Whittingham's case. He had been in correspondence
with his uncle for some time previous to his departure from Australia.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you tell me?&quot; cried Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is an established fact,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, expressing no
surprise; but Basil's tone no less than his words, opened his eyes still
further. &quot;A few days before Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham's death he wrote to his
nephew in Australia, announcing his change of intention. This letter was
forwarded to Mr. Basil by his uncle's lawyers, who, as you now know, are not the
same he employed in former years.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil Whittingham,&quot; said Basil, unable to repress his
excitement, &quot;received these letters in Australia?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Undoubtedly. He brought them home with him, and others also
which he had previously received from his uncle's lawyers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was a regular correspondence with them, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, extending over a considerable time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This was a fresh and startling revelation to Basil. Newman
Chaytor had not only personated him in England, but had personated him at a
distance, receiving letters intended for him and forging letters in reply.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He robbed me of my papers,&quot; groaned Basil inly, &quot;and obtained
possession of the means to prove him the man he represented himself to be. The
base, unutterable villain! He smiled in my face, a living lie! And I trusted in
him, believed in him, laid my heart bare to him, and all the time he was
planning my destruction. Just Heaven! Give me the power to bring him to the
punishment he deserves!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But did the foul plot go farther than this? Every time Chaytor
returned from the colonial post-office it was with the same answer--there were
no letters for Basil Whittingham. And the had received and answered them; they
were on his person while he was uttering the infamous falsehood, smiling in
Basil's face the while. To what depths would human cunning and duplicity go! The
tale, related to Basil by one who had been wronged, would have sounded
incredible. He would have asked, &quot;Is not this man labouring under some monstrous
delusion?&quot; But the bitter experience was his, and no tale would now be too wild
for disbelief. Again he asked himself, did the plot go farther than what had
already come to his knowledge? Newman Chaytor, going to the post-office for
letters for him, would receive all addressed to his name.</p>

<p class="normal">What if Annette had written? It was more than possible, it was
probable; it was more than probable, it was true. At this conclusion he quickly
arrived. Annette had redeemed her promise; she had written to him as she said
she would, and had received Chaytor's letters in reply. This explained how it
was that Chaytor had been able to find Annette and her uncle. Did Gilbert Bidaud
suspect, and was he trading upon the suspicion; and were the two villains
conspiring for the destruction of the poor girl's happiness? Basil looked round
pitifully, despairingly, as though invoking the assistance of an unknown power.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You seem disturbed,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, who had been
attentively observing him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The news you have imparted,&quot; said Basil, &quot;is terrible. Is
there no way of discovering this Basil Whittingham?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We might advertise for him,&quot; suggested Mr. Philpott.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil shook his head. &quot;If he saw the advertisement he would
not answer it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hallo,&quot; thought Mr. Philpott, &quot;our absent friend has done
something that would place him in the criminal dock.&quot; Professionally he was in
the habit of hiding his hand, so far as the expression of original thought went.
&quot;But some one who knows him,&quot; he said, &quot;might see the advertisement, and answer
for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil caught at the suggestion. &quot;Advertise, then, and in such
a manner as not to alarm him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Trust me for that,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, with great confidence.
&quot;I know how to bait my line.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But the advertisements meet with no response. Worked up to
fever heat, Basil instructed Mr. Philpott to spare no expense, and the inquiry
was prosecuted with wasted vigour, for at the end of two months they had not
advanced a step. Basil was in agony; he grew morbid, and raised up accusing
voices against himself. The reflection that Annette, the sweet and innocent
child who had given him her heart, should be in the power of two such villains
as Gilbert Bidaud and Newman Chaytor was an inexpressible torture to him. He had
accepted from her father a sacred trust--how had he fulfilled it? He inflicted
exquisite suffering upon himself by arguing that it was he who had betrayed her,
that it was through him she had been brought to this pass. Had she not known him
she would never had known Newman Chaytor; had he not worked upon her young
affections and extracted her promise to write to him it would have been
impossible that Chaytor should ever have crossed her path. He pressed into this
self-condemnation all the cruel logic his mind could devise. As he walked the
streets at night Annette's image arose before him and gazed upon him
reproachfully. &quot;You have compassed my ruin.&quot; It seemed to say, &quot;you are the
cause of my corruption, of my dishonour.&quot; He accepted the accusation, and
groaned, &quot;It is I, it is I, who have made your life a waste!&quot; Of all the
dolorous phases through which he had passed this perhaps was the worst. But he
had yet another bitter experience to encounter. On a Saturday evening Mr.
Philpott said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must speak honestly. I have done all I could, and nothing
has come of it. I might continue as long as you continued to engage my services,
but it would be only throwing your money away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was an unusual confession for a man in his line to make.
Private inquiry agents have generally the quality of the leech, and will suck
the last drop of blood out of a client, but Basil had won the commiseration of
his landlord.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must take the case into my own hands,&quot; said Basil gloomily.
&quot;I intended, indeed, to tell you as much myself--for pressing reasons. I thank
you for all you have done for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Little enough,&quot; said Mr. Philpott &quot;I wish you better luck
than I have had. Mind you, I don't give it up entirely, but if I do anything
more it will not be for pay.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are, and have been, very kind. Have you made out your
account?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Philpott presented it, and Basil settled it. Then he said:
&quot;Will you ask your wife to step up and see me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir. Now don't you be cast down, sir; it is a long lane
that has no turning, and there's no telling at any moment what may turn up. I
should like to take the liberty of asking one question.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ask it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If, after all, the search should be successful, is it likely
you would be in a better position than you are now? I am taking a liberty, I
know, but I don't mean it as such. You told me at first you were not
overburdened with funds; if it has been all going out and none coming in, you
must be worse off now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am very much worse off, Mr. Philpott. I will answer your
question. Should I succeed in finding the man I am hunting--a poor hunt it has
proved to be, with no quarry in view--I have reason to believe that I should
obtain funds which would enable me to discharge any liabilities I may incur.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, pushing across the table
the money which Basil had paid him; &quot;then suppose I wait.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Basil gently, &quot;take it while you are sure of it,
and you have a family.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But I can afford to wait, sir. If I lost ten times as much it
would not break me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must insist upon you taking it, Mr. Philpott.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was the pride of the poor gentleman, who would leave
himself penniless rather than leave an obligation unsettled. Mr. Philpott
recognised it as such, and recognised also that it marked the difference between
them--which increased the respect he felt for Basil. He pocketed the money
reluctantly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Send your wife up to me, Mr. Philpott.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil had indeed pressing reasons for dispensing with Mr.
Philpott's further services. The larger expenses of the last few weeks had
brought his funds to a very low ebb. He took out his purse and counted his
worldly wealth; it amounted to less than two pounds. He was standing at
poverty's door. In Australia, on the goldfields, it would not have mattered so
much. Earnest labour there can always ensure at least food for the passing day;
it is only the idle and dissolute and men without a backbone who have to endure
hunger; but here in this overcrowded city hunger is no rare experience to those
who are willing to toil. Needless to say that the watch and chain which had been
presented to Basil in Princetown was no longer in Basil's possession. The
prospect before him, physically and morally, was appalling.</p>

<p class="normal">There was a gentle knock at the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; said Basil,
and Mrs. Philpott entered the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My husband tells me you wish to see me, sir,&quot; said the
landlady.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take a seat, Mrs. Philpott,&quot; said Basil. &quot;I hope you have
brought your weekly account; you should have given it to me yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Friday's an unlucky day, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Philpott, fencing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But to-day is Saturday,&quot; said Basil, with a smile.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's no hurry, sir, I assure you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil looked at her and shook his head. His look, and the
weary, mournful expression on his face, brought tears to the good creature's
eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must insist upon having the account, Mrs. Philpott.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, sir, if you insist,&quot; said Mrs. Philpott, reduced to
helplessness; &quot;it is only the rent, seven shillings.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There are breakfasts,&quot; said Basil, &quot;with which you have been
good enough to supply me. I have not kept faith with you. When I took these
rooms I promised to pay always a fortnight's rent in advance; lately I have not
done so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How could you pay, sir, when you didn't know what the
breakfasts came to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That does not excuse me. Oblige me by telling me how much I
owe you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you won't be denied, sir, it's twelve and tenpence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There it is, and I am infinitely obliged to you. Mrs.
Philpott, I am sorry to say I must give you a week's notice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're never going to leave us, sir! Is there anything wrong
with the rooms? We'll have it put right in a twinkling.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The rooms are very comfortable, and I wish I could remain in
them; but it cannot be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must remain, sir, really you must. I won't take your
notice. You must sleep somewhere Philpott will never forgive me if I let you
go.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her consciousness of the strait he was in, and her pity for
it, were so unmistakable--her desire to befriend him and her sympathy were so
clearly expressed--that Basil covered his eyes with his hand, and remained
silent awhile. When he removed his hand he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am truly sensible of your goodness, Mrs. Philpott, but it
must be as I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Think better of it, sir,&quot; urged Mrs. Philpott. &quot;You are a
gentleman and I am only a common woman, but I am old enough to be your mother,
and I don't think you ought to treat me so--so&quot;--exactly the right word did not
occur to her, so she added--&quot;suddenly. Here you are, sir, all alone, if you'll
excuse me for saying so, and here <i>we</i> are with more rooms in the house
than we know what to do with. Why, sir, if you'll stay it will be obliging us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">All her kindly efforts were unavailing. She asked him to make
the notice a month instead of a week, and then she came down to a fortnight, and
made some reference to clouds with silver linings; but Basil was not to be
prevailed upon, and she left the room in a despondent state.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We'll keep an eye on him if we can,&quot; her husband said to her
when she gave him an account of the interview. &quot;I may find out something yet
that will be of use to him. It is a strange case, old woman, and I don't mind
confessing that I can't see the bottom of it.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h4><a name="div1_29" href="#div1Ref_29">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Sternly resolved to carry out his determination not to occupy
rooms for which he could not pay, Basil left Mrs. Philpott's house on the
appointed day. It was his wish to quit without being observed, but Mrs. Philpott
was on the look-out and lay in wait for him. Before he reached the street door
she barred his way in the landing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're not going away, sir,&quot; she said reproachfully, &quot;without
wishing the children good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In honest and affectionate friendship there is frequently
displayed a pleasant quality of cunning which it does no harm to meet with, and
in her exercise of it Mrs. Philpott pressed her children into the service. Basil
had no alternative but to accompany her into the parlour, where the four little
fellows were sitting at the table waiting for dinner.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You'll excuse me a minute, sir,&quot; said the good woman; &quot;if I
don't fill their plates before they're five minutes older they'll set up a
howl.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Out she bustled, and quickly returned with a mighty dish of
Irish stew.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Philpott says,&quot; said Mrs. Philpott as she placed the steaming
dish on the table, &quot;that no one in the world can make an Irish stew like mine;
and what father says is law, isn't it, children? I always have dinner with them,
sir; perhaps you'll join us. I really should like to know if you're of my
husband's opinion. Now this looks home-like&quot;--as Basil, who had independence of
spirit, but no false pride, took his seat at the table where a chair and a plate
had already been set for him--&quot;almost as if father was with us, or as if the
children had a great big brother who had been abroad ever so many years, and had
popped in quite sudden to surprise us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">All the time she was talking she was filling up the plates,
and the little party fell-to with a will, Basil eating as heartily as the rest.
Mrs. Philpott was delighted at the success of her ruse, but she was careful not
to show her pleasure, and when Basil said, in answer to her inquiry, that he had
had enough, she did not press him to take more. When dinner was over the
children had to be taken out of the room to have their faces washed; they were
brought back for Basil to kiss, and then were sent into the street to play
policemen.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You'll let us hear of you from time to time, sir,&quot; said Mrs.
Philpott, as she and Basil stood at the street door. &quot;Philpott is regular
downhearted because of your going. I'm not to let your rooms again, he says, so
there they are sir, ready for you whenever you do us the pleasure to come. We're
getting along in the world, sir, and the few shillings a-week don't matter to us
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am truly glad to hear it, Mrs. Philpott,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was a time,&quot; continued Mrs. Philpott, &quot;when it did
matter, and when every shilling was worth its weight in gold in a manner of
speaking. We've had our ups and downs, sir, as most people have, and if it
hadn't been for a friendly hand heaven only knows where we should be at this
present minute. We were in such low water, sir, we didn't know which way to
turn. Philpott says to me, 'Mother,' he says---- I hope I'm not wearying you,
sir,&quot; said Mrs. Philpott, breaking off in the middle of her sentence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pray go on,&quot; said Basil, feeling that it would be churlish to
check her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's a comfort, sir,&quot; continued Mrs. Philpott, &quot;to open one's
heart. It doesn't make me melancholy to look back to those days, though my
spirit was almost broke at the time; I'm proud and grateful that we've tided
them over, with the help of God and the good friend He sent us. 'Mother,' says
Philpott to me, 'I'm on my beam ends. We're in a wood, and there's no way out of
it.' 'Don't you go on like that, father,' I says; 'you keep on trying, and
you'll see a way out presently.' For I'm one of that sort of women, sir, if you
won't mind my saying as much, who never give in and don't know when they're
beat. I don't mean to say I don't suffer; I do, but I put a brave face on it and
never: say die. 'You keep on trying, father,' I says. 'Now haven't I kept on
trying?' says he. 'For eight weeks I've answered every advertisement in the
paper, and applied for a job in hundreds and hundreds of places without getting
the smell of one. I'm ashamed to look you in the face, mother, for if it wasn't
for you our boy would starve.' We only had one then, sir, and as for being
ashamed to look me in the face Philpott ought to have been ashamed to say as
much. All that I did was to get a day's charing wherever I could, and a bit of
washing when I heard there was a chance of it, and that was how we kept the wolf
from the door. But I fell ill, sir, and couldn't stir out of doors, and was so
weak that I couldn't stand at the wash-tub without fainting away. Things were
bad indeed then, and Philpott took on so that I did lose heart a bit. Well, sir,
when we'd parted with everything we could raise a penny upon, when we didn't
know where we should get our next meal from though it was only dry bread, heaven
sent us a friend. An old friend of Philpott's, sir, that he hadn't seen for
years, and that he'd been fond of and kind to when he was a young man, before he
kept company with me. Philpott had lent him a couple of pound, and he'd gone off
to America, and, now, sir, now, in the very nick of time, he came home to pay it
back. Did you ever see the sun shine as bright as bright can be in a dark room
at ten o'clock at night--for that was the time when Philpott's friend opened the
door, and cried, 'Does Mr. Philpott live here?' It shone in our room, sir,
though there was never a candle to light it up, and Philpott was sitting by me
with his head in his hands. Philpott starts up in a fright--when people are in
the state we were brought to the least unexpected, thing makes their hearts beat
with fear--he starts up and says, 'Who are you?' 'That's Philpott's voice,' says
our friend. 'I'd know it among a thousand; but don't you know mine, old fellow?
And what are you sitting in the dark for?' Then he tells us who he is, and
Philpott takes hold of his hand and says he's glad to see his old friend--which
he couldn't, sir--and, ashamed of his poverty, pulls him out of the room. He
comes back almost directly, and stoops over me and kisses me, and whispers that
heaven has sent us a friend when most we needed one, and I feel my dear man's
tears on my face. Then, sir, if you'll believe me it seemed to me as if the sun
was shining in our dark room, and all the trouble in my mind flew straight away.
From that time all went well with us; it was right about face in real earnest.
Philpott's friend had another friend who got my husband in the force, and now
we've got a bit of money put by for a rainy day, and don't need the rent for a
couple of empty rooms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Philpott's account of her troubles was much longer than
she intended to make it, and her concluding words were spoken wistfully and
appealingly. They were not lost upon Basil, but they did not turn him from his
purpose. With a kindly pressure of her hand, and promising to call and see her
unless circumstances prevented--which meant unless his fortunes remained in
their present desperate condition--he took his leave of her and passed out of
her sight.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Poor young gentleman,&quot; sighed the good woman. &quot;I would have
given the world if he'd have stopped with us. What on earth will become of him?
It's hard to come down like that. Better to be born poor and remain so, than to
be born rich and lose everything. His face was the image of despair, though he
was politeness itself all the time I was talking. I sha'n't be able to get him
out of my head.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She and her husband talked of him that night, and if kind
wishes and sympathising words were of practical value, Basil would have been
comforted and strengthened.</p>

<p class="normal">Strengthened in some poor way he was. It had been his hard
fate to be made the victim of as black treachery as one man ever practised
towards another; but he had met with kindness also at the hands of strangers. He
strove to extract consolation from that reflection. Heaven knows he needed it,
for he was now to make acquaintance with poverty in its grimmest aspect. He was
absolutely powerless. He had debated with himself various courses which might be
said to be open to a man in his extremity, but he saw no possible road to
success in any one of them. The most feasible was that he should go to a capable
lawyer and endeavour to enlist his skill on his behalf. But what lawyer would
listen to a man who presented himself with a tale so strange and without the
smallest means to pay for services rendered? It would be a natural conclusion
that he was mad, or that he, being Newman Chaytor, was adopting this desperate
expedient to prove himself to be Basil Whittingham. That he was a gentleman was
true; he had the manners of one, but so had many who were not gentlemen. Then
his appearance was against him; he had no other clothes than those he stood
upright in, and these were shabby and in bad repair. Even if he had possessed
assurance, it would not have served him--nay, it would have told against him, as
proclaiming, &quot;Here is a plausible scoundrel, who seeks to deceive us by
swagger.&quot; He was truly in a helpless plight.</p>

<p class="normal">The necessity of living was forced upon him, and to live a man
must have money to purchase food. Recalling the efforts made by Mr. Philpott in
his days of distress, as described by that man's good wife, he applied for
situations he saw advertised, but there were a hundred applicants for every
office, and he ever arrived too late, or was pushed aside, or was considered
unsuitable. In one of his applications he was very nearly successful, but it
came to a question of character, and he had no reference except the editor of
the
<i>Princetown Argus</i>, who was fourteen thousand miles away. What wonder that
he was laughed at and dismissed? Then he thought that his experiences on the
goldfields and his training as a journalist might help him, and he wrote some
sketches and articles and sent them to magazines and newspapers. He heard
nothing of them after they were dropped into the editorial boxes. The fault may
have been his own, for he had no heart to throw spirit into his effusions, but
his state was no less pitiable because of that. He felt as if indeed he had for
ever lost his place in the world. By day he walked the streets, and at night
occupied a bed in the commonest of London lodging-houses. At first he paid
fourpence for his bed, but latterly he could afford no more than two-pence, and
presently he would not be able to afford even that. It was a stipulation of his
nightly accommodation that he should turn out early in the morning, and this he
was willing enough to do, for he had but little sleep, and the beings he was
compelled to herd with filled him with dismay. It was not their poverty that
shocked him; it was their language, their sentiments, their expressions of
pleasure in all that was depraved. He had had no idea of the existence of such
classes, and now that he came face to face with them he shrank from them in
horror. Had they been merely thieves it is possible that he might have tolerated
them, and even entertained pity for them, arguing that they were born to theft,
that their parents had been thieves before them and had taught them no better;
or that they had been driven into the ranks by sheer necessity; but it was the
corruption of their souls that terrified him; it was the consciousness that with
vice and virtue placed for them to choose, with means for each, they would have
chosen vice and revelled in it. Amid all this corruption and degradation he
maintained a pitiable self-respect and kept his soul pure. Often did he go
without a meal, but he would listen to no temptations, electing by instinct,
rather to suffer physically than to lower his moral nature to the level of those
by whom he was surrounded. When he walked the streets by day he did not walk
aimlessly and without purpose. It was probable enough that Newman Chaytor was in
London, and if so the fortune of which he had obtained fraudulent possession
would enable him to live in the best and most fashionable quarters of the city.
Basil haunted those better localities, and watched for the villain who had
betrayed him in the vicinity of the grand hotels, the clubs, and the resorts of
fashion in the parks. Sometimes at night he lingered about the high-class
theatres to see the audience come out. In the event of his meeting his enemy he
had no settled plan except that he would endeavour to find out where he lived,
and through that knowledge to obtain access to Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">One night he met with a strange adventure. He had come from
Covent Garden, where, mingling in the crowd, he had watched the audience issue
from the Opera House, in which a famous songstress had been singing. It was an
animated, bustling scene, but it was impossible for a man in such sore distress
to take pleasure in it; neither did he draw bitterness from the gaiety; he
merely looked on with a pathos in his eyes which was now their usual expression.
Frequently, in his days of prosperity, had he attended the opera, as one of the
fashion, and heard this same songstress, whose praise was on every man's lips;
now he was an outcast, hungry, almost in rags, without even a name which the
world would accept as his by right of birth and inheritance. It was a cold
night, but dry--that was a comfort to a poorly clad man. Indeed, there is in all
conditions of life something to be grateful for, if we would only seek for it.</p>

<p class="normal">A curious fancy entertained Basil's mind. He heard the
carriages called out--&quot;Lady This's carriage,&quot; &quot;Lord That's carriage,&quot; &quot;The
Honourable T'other's carriage.&quot; How if &quot;Mr. Basil Whittingham's carriage&quot; was
called out? So completely was he for the moment lost to the sad realities of his
position, so thoroughly did the fancy take possession of him, that he actually
listened for the announcement, and had it been made it is probable that he would
have pushed his way through the crowd with the intention of entering the
carriage. But nothing of the kind occurred. Gradually the theatre was emptied,
and the audience wended homeward, riding or afoot, north, south, east, and west,
till only the fringe was left--night-birds who filtered slowly to their several
haunts, not all of which could boast of roof and bed. A night-bird himself,
Basil walked slowly on towards Westminster. He had fivepence in his pocket, and
no prospect of adding anything to it to-morrow, and he was considering whether
he should spend twopence for a bed, or pass the night on a bench on the
Embankment. It was a weighty matter to decide, as important to him as the debate
which was proceeding in the House, upon which a nation's destiny hung. In
Parliament Street a young couple brushed past him; they had been supping after
the theatre, and Basil heard the man address the woman, as &quot;Little Wifey,&quot; and
saw her nestle closer to her husband's arm as he uttered this term of
endearment. For a moment Basil forgot his own misery, and a bright smile came to
his lips; but it faded instantly, and he trudged wearily on discussing the
momentous question of bed or bench. Undecided, he found himself on Westminster
Bridge, where he stood gazing upon the long panorama of lights from lamps and
stars. Were this wonderful and suggestive picture situated in a foreign country,
English people would include it in their touring jaunts and come home and rave
about it, but as it is situated in London its beauties are unheeded.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil, leaning over the stone rampart, looking down into the
river, was presently conscious that some person was standing by his side. He
turned his head, and saw a woman, who gazed with singular intentness upon him.
She was neither young nor fair, but she had traces of beauty in her face which
betokened that in her springtime she could not have been without admirers. Her
age was about thirty, and she was well dressed. So much Basil took in at a
glance, and then he averted his eyes and resumed his walk across the bridge. The
woman followed him closely, and when he paused and gently waved her off, she
said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why do you avoid me? I want nothing of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-night, then,&quot; said Basil in a kind voice, and would have
proceeded on his way if the woman had not prevented him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, not good-night yet,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you not understand me
when I said I want nothing of you? It is true; but happening to catch sight of
your face as I was crossing the bridge I could not pass without speaking to you.
It would have brought a punishment upon me--knowing what I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Being compelled by her persistence to a closer observance of
her, Basil was moved to a certain pity for her. There were tears in her eyes and
a pathos in her voice which touched him. Desolate outcast as he was, whom the
world, if he proclaimed himself, would declare to be an impostor, what kind of
manhood was that which would refuse a word of compassion to a woman who appeared
to be in affliction? His pitying glance strangely affected her; she clung to the
stone wall and burst into a passion of tears.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am sorry for your trouble,&quot; said Basil, waiting till she
had recovered herself. &quot;Can I do anything to help you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing,&quot; she replied. &quot;No one can help me. I have lost all I
love in the world. This is a strange meeting; I have been thinking of you
to-day, but never dreamt I should see you to-night. To-night of all nights!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thinking of me!&quot; exclaimed Basil in amazement.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will not consider it strange,&quot; said the woman, &quot;when you
know all. I could not stop at home; I have been sitting by her side since three
o'clock, and then a voice whispered to me, 'Go out for an hour, look up to
Heaven where the Supreme Guide is, and pray for a miracle.' So I came out, and
have been praying to Him to give her back to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Poor woman!&quot; murmured Basil, for now he knew from her words
that she had lost one who was dear to her. &quot;I pity you from my heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are changed,&quot; said the woman; &quot;not in face, for I should
have known you anywhere, but in your voice and manner. It is gentler, kinder
than it used to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil did not answer her: he thought that grief had affected
her mind, and that her words bore no direct relation to himself. He had no
suspicion of the truth which was subsequently to be revealed to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is many years since we met,&quot; she said. &quot;Have you been long
in England?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A few months,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have not made your fortune?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You look poor enough. Have you no money?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None,&quot; said Basil; and added hastily, &quot;or very little.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have been unfortunate since your return home?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very unfortunate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She opened her purse, and took out a sovereign and held it out
to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you no,&quot; said Basil, his wonder growing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are changed indeed,&quot; said the woman, &quot;to refuse money. It
is honestly come by. Two years ago I was married, and my husband, who died a
year afterwards, left me a small income. It was more than I deserved, for I
deceived him by telling him I was a widow. It made no difference, but still it
was a deceit. Will you not take it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And yet you need it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do not urge me further. Good night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Wait one moment. I was going to tell you to-night; but you
had best see for yourself. It is your right. Here is my address; my mother and
sister live with me. Come and see me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. Promise
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I cannot promise,&quot; said Basil, moving away. &quot;You must
promise,&quot; said the woman, moving after him. &quot;I will not leave you till you do. I
tell you it is your right--it is more than your right, it is your duty.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Seeing there was no other way to release himself from her,
Basil said, &quot;I promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On your sacred word of honour,&quot; said the woman.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On my sacred word of honour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will trust you; there was a time when I would not. Good
night. To-morrow, at ten.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She glided away, and Basil was once more alone. The misery of
his own circumstances was no encouragement to him to dwell upon the adventure,
and he dismissed it from his mind, accounting for the woman's strange utterances
by the supposition that she was of weak intellect. He passed the night in the
open air, and in the morning bought one pennyworth of bread--it was cheaper than
buying a penny roll--for his breakfast. This and water from a drinking-fountain
satisfied hunger and thirst.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A man can live upon very little,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;but
how is it going to end?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was a pertinent question, and answered itself. The end
seemed near and certain.</p>

<p class="normal">It was a bright morning, and he walked in the sun. He did not
forget the promise he had made to the woman; it was a promise to which he had
pledged himself, and even if mischief resulted it must be fulfilled. The name on
the card was Mrs. Addison the address, Queen Street, Long Acre. Thither he went,
and paused before a milliner's shop, the windows of which were partially masked
by shutters. Over the shop front was the name Addison, and the goods displayed
bore evidence of a certain prosperity; they were not of the poorest kind. An
elderly, grey-haired woman came forward as he entered. Her face was sad and
severe, and there was no civility in her voice as she informed him in answer to
his question, that he had come to the right address.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go through that door,&quot; she said with a frown, &quot;up-stairs to
the first landing. My daughter expects you. I must ask you to make your visit
short.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was not only that her voice was cold, it expressed
repugnance, and without requesting an explanation Basil followed her and mounted
the stairs. The sound of his footsteps brought the woman he had met on
Westminster Bridge to the door of the front room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have kept your promise,&quot; she said. &quot;Come in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A younger woman than she rose as he entered, cast one brief
glance at him, and immediately left the room. The window blinds were down and
the gas was lighted. His strange acquaintance of the previous night was dressed
in deep mourning. Her face was white and swollen with weeping.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I prayed for a miracle last night,&quot; she said, &quot;but my prayers
were not answered. I have also repented that I asked you to come, but still it
is right, it is right. If you have a heart it should be a punishment to you for
all you have made me suffer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not in the least understand you,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">Had it not been for her grief her look would have been
scornful. She paid no heed to his words, but continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When I said last night that I wanted nothing of you I said
what I meant. When you go from here I wish never to see your face again. It will
be useless for you to trouble me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall not trouble,&quot; said Basil in a gentle tone which
seemed to make her waver; but she would not yield to this softer mood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That you are poor to-day,&quot; she said, &quot;and I am well-to-do, so
far as money goes, proves that there is a Providence. Years ago--very soon after
your desertion of me--I cast you from my heart, and resolved never to admit you
into it again. It might have been otherwise had you behaved honestly to me, for
I loved you, and you made me believe that you loved me. It was better for me
that the tie which bound us should be broken. I have led a respectable life, and
shall continue to do so. I am the happier for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For heaven's sake,&quot; cried Basil, &quot;explain what it is you
accuse me of.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ask your own heart. Although there is an apparent change in
you, you are still the same, I see, in cunning and duplicity. But I will listen
to no subterfuges; there is no possibility of your justifying yourself, and your
power over me is gone. Towards you my heart is cold as stone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are labouring under some singular delusion,&quot; said Basil,
&quot;and I can but listen to you in wonder.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still the same, still the same,&quot; said the woman. &quot;You used to
boast of your superior powers, and that you were so perfect an actor that you
could make the cleverest believe that black was white. See what it has brought
you to&quot;--she pointed to his rags. &quot;I have no pity for you; as you have sown, so
have you reaped. So might I have reaped had I not seen the pit you treacherously
dug for me; so might I have reaped had I not repented before it was entirely too
late. I owe you this much gratitude--that it was your base desertion of me that
showed me my sin. Had you remained I might have sunk lower and lower till grace
and redemption were lost to me for ever. What expiation was possible for me I
have made, with sincere repentance, with sincere sorrow for my error. It would
be well for you if you could say the same. You saw my mother downstairs. She
cast me off, as you know, but she opened her arms to me when I convinced her of
my sincerity, when I vowed to her to live a pure life. I am again her daughter.
You see these drawn blinds, you see my dress, you see that this is a house of
mourning. Can you guess what for?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed I cannot,&quot; said Basil, &quot;except that you have lost one
who is dear to you. What comfort can I, a stranger, offer you that you cannot
find for yourself? It is small consolation to say that your loss is a common
human experience. Be faith your solace. There is a hereafter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her scorn and horror of him, now plainly expressed in her
face, so overpowered her that she allowed him to finish without interruption.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You, a stranger to me!&quot; she cried. &quot;Will you still wear the
mask--or is it, <i>is</i> it possible that the rank selfishness and callousness
of your nature can have made you forget? All was over between us--but a link
remained, a link of sweet and beautiful love which the good Lord has taken from
me. I bow my head; I will not, I must not rebel!&quot; She folded her hands, and,
moving to the darkened window, stood for a few moments there engaged in silent
prayer. Presently she spoke again. &quot;My fond hopes pictured a bright and happy
future for her. I, her mother, would be for ever by her side, guiding her from
the pitfalls which lay before young and confiding innocence. Her life should be
without stain, without reproach. She did not know, she would never have known
the stain which rests upon mine. It is revealed to her now. Forgive me, my
darling, and look down with pity upon me! Yes, out of my sin I created a garden
of love--for her, who was to me what sight would be to the blind, through whose
sweet and pure influence I was led to the Divine throne. My fond hopes have been
dashed to the ground--they are dead, never to be revived. Come with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With noiseless footsteps she walked out of the room, and Basil
followed her to another on the same landing. Softly, tenderly, as though fearful
of disturbing what was therein, she turned the handle, and she and Basil stood
in the presence of death.</p>

<p class="normal">Of death in its fairest form. Upon the bed lay the body of a
young girl whose age might be ten. The sweet beauty, the peace, the perfect rest
in the child's face, moved Basil to tears; she looked like a sleeping angel.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, my darling, my darling!&quot; sobbed the bereaved mother,
sinking to her knees. &quot;Pray for me; intercede for me. Unconsciously I strayed; I
saw not my sin. Oh, child of shame and love, bring peace to my breaking heart,
and do not turn from me when we meet above!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil spoke no word; some consciousness of the truth was
slowly coming to him. There was a silence in the room for several minutes; then
the woman rose to her feet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Kiss her,&quot; she said. &quot;When you last saw her she was a baby.
If she were living, and saw your face, she would look upon you as a stranger;
but now she knows the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then Basil understood. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said inly, &quot;now she knows the
truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He stooped and kissed the child's lips, and the mother's tears
broke out afresh; checking them presently, she said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was by the strangest chance I met you last night. I have
done what I conceived to be my duty. Now go,&quot; and she pointed to the door.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will obey you,&quot; said Basil, &quot;but I must say a word to you
first, in the next room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She looked at him for a moment hesitatingly, then nodded her
head, and they left the chamber of death as noiselessly as they had entered it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did not intend it,&quot; said the woman, and taking a tress of
fair hair from her bosom, and dividing it, she offered him a portion. &quot;You may
like to keep it as a remembrance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank you humbly,&quot; said Basil; &quot;it may help me on my way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A look of incredulous wonder flashed into her face, but
remained there only an instant, and she shook her head as though she were
answering a question she had asked mutely of herself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Before us lies an open grave,&quot; she said. &quot;You and I speak now
together for the last time on earth. I forgive you, as I hope to be forgiven.
You have something to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes; and I entreat you, however strange you may think my
question, to suspend your indignation for awhile, and answer me in plain words.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will endeavour to do so, if it is such a question as you
should address to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not fret you by arguments or expostulations. You have
suffered deeply, and from my heart I pity you. Plainly, whom do you take me
for?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For yourself--for no other man, be sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But let me hear my name from your lips.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As you insist upon it,&quot; she said, with sad contempt, &quot;though
such a farce should not be played at such a time; but when were you otherwise
than you are? You are Newman Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I,&quot; said Basil, speaking very slowly, &quot;am Newman Chaytor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are he; there lives not such another, and remembering all
that has passed between us, remembering your vows and oaths, for that I say,
thank God! If you have any reason for going by another name, for wishing to be
known by another name--and you may have, heaven help you!--be sure that I will
not betray you. You are dead to me, as I am dead to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Look at me well,&quot; said Basil. &quot;If you were upon your oath
would you swear that I am the man you say I am?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To swear otherwise would be to swear falsely. What crime have
you committed that you should stand in dread of being known?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None. It is not to be expected that you will believe when I
tell you that you are the victim of delusion, as I am the victim of a foul and
monstrous plot.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who would believe you? Denial is easy enough, and of course
you will deny, having reason to do so. But come into the light.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She raised the blind, and he stepped to the window where the
light shone upon his face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are Newman Chaytor,&quot; she repeated, letting the blind
fall.</p>

<p class="normal">He bowed his head, and said, &quot;You have just cause for your
pitiless resentment and whether I am or am not the man you believe me to be, I
bow my head before you in sorrow and shame. The day may come--I do not know how,
or in what way it may be brought about, for I am at the extremity of
misery--when, showing you this&quot;--he touched his breast, where he placed the lock
of her child's hair--&quot;and recalling this interview, you will see the error into
which you have innocently fallen. Till then, or for ever, farewell.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One moment,&quot; said the woman, with trembling accents, &quot;what
has passed cannot be recalled, nor will I speak of the folly of your denial of
the solemn truth. It is a meaningless proceeding.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To me,&quot; said Basil, interrupting her, &quot;it means everything.
Honour, truth, fidelity, faith in virtue and goodness, all are at stake. It may
never come to an issue, for the end seems near, but heaven may yet have some
mercy in store for me. As you prayed for a miracle last nigh: which was not
vouchsafed you, so will I pray for a miracle to help me to a just conclusion of
my bitter trials.&quot; A pitiful smile accompanied his words. &quot;It is not for me, one
suffering man among millions happier, I trust, than myself, to doubt Divine
Goodness. The eternal principle of Justice remains and will, now or hereafter,
assert itself, as it has ever done. May peace and comfort, and happiness be
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I offered you money last night,&quot; said the woman, impressed by
what he said, but making no comment upon it. &quot;Will you not accept it now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I, thank you--no,&quot; he said bowing to her with humility.
&quot;Farewell.&quot;</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_30" href="#div1Ref_30">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Basil's mind was quite clear when he left the house, and as he
had bowed his head to the bereaved mother when she declared him to be Newman
Chaytor, the villain who had betrayed and cast her off, so did he bow his head
to the elder woman in the shop below, who flung upon him a look of anger and
abhorrence as he passed from her sight. In the light of the infamous wrong
inflicted upon this family, the wrong inflicted upon himself seemed to be
lessened. Suffering and humiliation were his portion, but not shame; herein
Newman Chaytor was powerless. There had grown in his mind an ideal presentment
of womanhood which shed a refined and delicate grace upon all his dealings with
the sex. His knowledge of the world had taught him that some had fallen and were
vile, but he had no harsh thoughts even for these hapless ones, whom he regarded
with tender pity. There were women with whom he had come in contact whose images
were touched with sacred light. His mother was one, Annette was another; and it
was partly this good influence which enabled him to bear, with some degree of
moral fortitude, the weight of the troubles through which he was passing. A
heavy load had been added to these troubles by the accusation which now had been
brought against him; another man's sins had been thrust upon his shoulders, and
the circumstantial evidence against him was so strong that he could scarcely
hope to break it down. He had said that he would pray for a miracle to aid him
in his bitter trials, and indeed it seemed as if nothing short of a miracle
would serve him. But although none occurred to bring the truth to light, new
experiences were awaiting him as strange as any within his ken, and one, with
some sweet touch of humanity in it, was to come indirectly through the enemy who
had played him false.</p>

<p class="normal">Of the fourpence he had left one penny went that day for food,
and he contrasted his position with that of a shipwrecked man cast away in a
boat, helpless on a wild and desolate sea, with starvation staring him in the
face. &quot;Among these millions,&quot; he thought, &quot;I cannot be the only one; there must
be others adrift as I am. Heaven pity them!&quot; It was curious that, revolving this
theme in his mind, he looked about for men and women whose state resembled his
own, and fancying he saw some, longed for money more for their sake than for his
own. Only in small natures is grief entirely selfish. One question continually
presented itself. What could he do to better himself--what do to turn the tide?
He saw people begging in the roadways, and others fighting desperately for dear
life, their weapons a few boxes of matches. If he had known where to purchase
half-a-dozen boxes for the threepence which still remained of his fortune he
would have risked the venture, but he did not know where to go for the
investment, and those he asked for information scowled at him or turned away,
conscious perhaps that their ranks were overcrowded, or that the addition of one
to the horde of mendicants would lessen their chances. During these times he
gained pregnant knowledge of a social nature. Living entirely in the streets,
pictures presented themselves in poor and rich thoroughfares alike. His poverty
made the contrasts startling. Ladies in carriages nursing over-fed lapdogs;
small morsels of humanity shuffling along with their toes peeping out of their
boots. In Covent Garden hothouse fruit at fabulous prices, and white-faced
mortals picking up refuse and stealthily devouring it. Grand parties in great
mansions, priceless jewels flashing as the ladies stepped out of their
carriages; in a street hard by a woe-worn girl asleep on a doorstep, with a
pallid baby in her arms. These pictures did not embitter him; he pitied the poor
and envied not the rich, and had it been his good fortune to be employed as a
descriptive writer, his pen would not have been dipped in gall. He did not
purposely linger as he walked the streets, for the reason that when he lagged he
attracted the notice of policemen, who followed him slowly, and quietly noted
his movements. On such occasions, feeling himself an object of suspicion, he
would quicken his steps to escape closer observation. Through all these sad
wanderings he was ever on the watch for Newman Chaytor; he would not allow
himself to sink into absolute apathy; while life remained he would do what lay
in his power to lift himself out of the slough of despond. Only when his
strength was exhausted would he lie down and die. Thus did he endure three more
doleful days, at the end of which his last penny was spent. &quot;The end is coming,&quot;
he thought, and waited for it. He had been five nights now without a bed, and on
three of these nights had been soaked to the skin. This exposure, with lack of
nourishing food, had already told upon a system constitutionally sound and
healthy. That the end was coming was no idle reflection; he felt it in his
bones. Whither should he turn for succour? Naturally strong, and willing and
anxious to work even for the barest pittance, he found himself more forsaken and
powerless in this city of unrest than Robinson Crusoe on his desolate island.
Charity is proverbially cold; it is frozen indeed when a willing man is driven
to such a pass.</p>

<p class="normal">Another day passed, and another soaking night, and then fever
threatened. Delirious fancies took possession of him, haunted, tortured and
deluded him. He laughed aloud in the street, and aroused to momentary reason by
the looks of the passers-by, shambled away in silence that engirt him as with
iron bands--to break out again presently when he was in another street. Each
night some impulse for which he sought no reason led his steps in the direction
of the bridge where he had met Newman Chaytor's victim; had he seen her again,
and she had offered him money, it is doubtful whether he would have had the
strength to refuse.</p>

<p class="normal">Exhausted and spent, having been thirty hours without food, he
clung to the buttress of the bridge, and with dim eyes looked forward on the
river's lights. There seemed to be some meaning in their unrest; from the
mysterious depths messages from another world came to his dazed mind.
&quot;Presently, presently,&quot; he thought, &quot;but I should like first to see Annette, and
undeceive her. I would give my best heart's blood to set myself straight with
her. Too late to save her--too late, too late!&quot; He had no idea of seeking
eternal rest by deliberate action, only that he felt it was very near, and could
not be long delayed.</p>

<p class="normal">How he craved for food! How the demon hunger was tearing at
his vitals! His head fell forward, his mouth sucked his coat sleeve. A policeman
touched his arm; he languidly raised his head, and the policeman gazed steadily
at him, and then proceeded on his beat without speaking a word. Maybe he
recognised that a case of genuine suffering was before him. Basil remained in
the same position, his eyes turned in the direction the officer was taking. But
he did not see him; he was blind to all surrounding things. Therefore it was
that he had no consciousness of the presence of an old woman, poorly dressed,
who had stopped when the policeman stopped, and appeared rooted to the spot as
her eyes fell upon Basil's face. Suddenly the emotion which for a brief space
had overpowered her, found voice. With a piercing scream she tottered towards
Basil, cleared the grey hair from her eyes, and peered up into his face. Then
with a piercing scream, she cried:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Newman! My son, my darling, darling son! O God be thanked for
restoring you to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She threw her trembling arms around him, but Basil did not
feel them, and had no understanding of her words. With a dolorous groan he slid
from her arms to the ground, and lay there without sense or motion. Nature's
demands had reached a supreme point, and the groan which issued from his lips
was the last effort of exhausted strength.</p>

<p class="normal">Although the bridge appeared to be deserted, with only the
policeman, the old woman, and Basil in view, a small knot of persons, as if by
magic, instantly surrounded the fallen man and the woman who knelt by his side.
The policeman, attracted by the scream, turned, and slowly sauntered towards the
group.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What's the matter, mother?&quot; asked an onlooker.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's my son,&quot; moaned the woman, &quot;my dear son, Newman. He has
come from the goldfields, and is dying, dying.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't look much like a goldfields man,&quot; observed one of the
group. &quot;Where's his nuggets?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has had a hard time,&quot; continued the woman, whom the reader
will recognise as Mrs. Chaytor. &quot;He wrote to me about his hardships. See what
they have brought him to. Will none of you help me? Here is money--I am not so
poor as I look; my poor husband has had a bit of luck. For pity's sake help me!
O my son, my son!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am a doctor,&quot; said a gentleman, pushing his way through.
Kneeling by Mrs. Chaytor's side, he lifted Basil's head on his knee, and made a
rapid examination. &quot;The poor fellow is starving, I should say. Run, one of you,
and fetch a quartern of brandy--and some water if you can get it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Chaytor held out a trembling hand, and a woman snatched
the money from lit and darted off. The policeman, who had by this time joined
the group, shook his head disapprovingly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You've seen the last of that,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">He was mistaken, however; the woman returned with two flat
bottles, one containing brandy, the other water. With these the doctor moistened
Basil's lips, and forced a few drops down his throat.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You see,&quot; he said, addressing himself to Mrs. Chaytor, &quot;that
he is not yet dead. Whether he lives or dies depends not upon himself. I think I
heard you say you are his mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am his unhappy mother,&quot; sobbed Mrs. Chaytor. &quot;Oh, how I
have prayed for his return, and he is sent to me now like this! It is cruel, it
is unjust. Save him for me, doctor, and I will bless you to the last hour of my
life!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We will see what can be done. Do you live near here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We live in Southwark Road.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here is a cab passing. Let us get him into it; there is no
time to lose.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A dozen arms were ready to assist him, but Basil had grown so
thin that the kind doctor lifted him with ease, and put him in the cab. Then,
giving the driver the address which he obtained from Mrs. Chaytor, they drove
off quickly, Mrs. Chaytor holding Basil in her arms, and crooning over him as
the priceless treasure of her life.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_31" href="#div1Ref_31">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Am I awake or dreaming?&quot; This was the thought that passed
through Basil's mind as he opened his eyes. Two weeks had passed since he had
been rescued from death; and for the most of that time he had been unconscious.
But certain floating impressions were his, which now, as his eyes travelled
round the walls of the room in which he lay, he endeavoured to recall. It was
not without difficulty that he succeeded, but after long and determined--if in
his weak state such a word may be used--effort, these impressions began to
marshal themselves. But just at the moment that memory reasserted its power an
interruption occurred, and Basil, bent upon his mental task, closed his eyes,
and waited once more for solitude.</p>

<p class="normal">An old woman stole softly into the room, and crept with
noiseless tread close to his bed. She stooped over him, kissed him tenderly,
arranged the bedclothes about him, smoothed his pillow, and kissed him again.
What touched his feelings deeply was the exceeding tenderness of these kisses,
which could only have been bestowed upon one who was very dear. What meaning lay
in this strange tenderness to him who not so long since was forsaken by all, and
coming from one whose face was absolutely unfamiliar to him? For with excusable
cunning he had partially raised his lids without being observed, and his
half-veiled eyes rested upon the woman who was attending him. She was an old
woman with grey and white hair, and there were signs of deep suffering on her
lined face. She looked like one who had experienced great trouble, but Basil
noted also in her countenance an expression of gratitude which relieved the
weight of years and care which lay heavy upon her. He allowed his lids to droop,
and setting aside awhile the task upon which he was engaged when she entered the
room, ransacked his memory for a clue. He could find none, even though his
mental efforts sent him wandering weakly among his childhood's days. While thus
engaged, with his eyes still closed, he was conscious that another person had
entered the room, and the words which passed between them reached his senses.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning,&quot; in the cheerful voice of a man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good morning, doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Doctor! He was being cared for, then, and friends were by his
side. Of this he was assured; he required no further proof than the tender
actions of the woman and the soft voice in which she returned the doctor's
greeting. But why should these stranger's care for him? for strangers to him
they were, though their intentions could not be doubted.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How is our patient this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No worse, I hope, doctor. He has been very, very quiet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is a good sign.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil felt the doctor's fingers on his pulse, and then his
head was gently raised, and he knew that his temperature was being taken. He
betrayed no consciousness of their presence; perhaps the conversation would
supply him with the clue for which he was seeking.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The fever has almost gone; in a few days he will be quite
well. Has he not spoken at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not even in his sleep?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, doctor, not a word has passed his lips.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All the signs are good. Has he opened his eyes?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, doctor. If he only would! If he would only recognise me!
I could die happy, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must not talk of dying. All that belongs to the past.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, doctor,&quot; said the woman, with a sigh, &quot;it belongs to the
future.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I stand corrected in my philosophy. But, tush, tush! We must
not have you breaking down. I shall insist upon your getting a nurse for our
young gentleman here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, doctor, no,&quot; in almost a fierce tone, &quot;no one shall nurse
my dear boy but myself. Have I waited all these years to let another woman take
my place?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Be calm. But I warn you that you are overtaxing yourself, and
at your time of life it is not safe. You have done your duty; no woman can do
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not allow anybody else to take my place. It belongs to
me; it is my right.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There, there, don't agitate yourself. I hope our young friend
will be grateful for what you have done for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will be; he always has been; you do not know his
nature--the most loving, the tenderest. Can you not see it in his face?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a good face, and I have taken something more than a
doctor's interest in the case. It is, indeed, a mercy that you came across him
on the bridge a fortnight ago. Had he fallen into the hands of strangers it is
hardly likely he would have pulled through. It was touch and go with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Providence led my steps. I am humbly, humbly grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You saved him from death--I may tell you plainly now that he
is in a fair way of recovery. And how is our other patient?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still the same, doctor. Will you go and see him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must come with me; he is suspicious of me, as you know,
and would order me out of the room if you were not by.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can I leave my dear boy with safety?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With perfect safety; he will not awake from sleep for a long
time yet, and when he does it will not harm him to find himself alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He must not find himself alone--I will not have it, I will
not, I will not!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, well, surely you can take my word. He will sleep for
hours; it is nature's restorative.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Doctor,&quot; said the woman, in a tone so solicitous that Basil
was deeply moved, &quot;he <i>will</i> recover?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will. Come; I have not much time at my disposal.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He walked to the door, but before she left the room, Basil
felt her tender hands about him again, ministering to his ease and comfort.
Presently he knew by the closing of the door that he was alone again. Then he
applied himself to the task of recalling his impressions. They came to him
slowly, and the sequence of events passed through his mind in fair order.</p>

<p class="normal">He recalled the dolorous days of hunger and privation, the
meeting of the young woman on the bridge, his visit to her house, and the cruel
accusation she brought against him. When he struggled against it she had desired
him to come into the light, and had said, &quot;You are Newman Chaytor.&quot; With this
pronouncement and condemnation he left her, and the look of abhorrence the
woman's mother had cast upon him lived in his memory as a burning brand. Then
followed the days through which he starved and suffered till he was on the
bridge looking forward on the river's lights, and waiting for death. He had no
remembrance of what subsequently occurred on that night and on many days and
nights afterwards. Sounds of voices he had heard, but not the sense of the words
that were spoken: except that on one occasion something had reached his senses
to the effect that the room in which he lay was unhealthy, and that it would be
better if he were removed to more airy quarters. He was dimly conscious that
this was done, and that gentle hands had lifted him from his bed, and that he
was carried to another house through fresher air which flowed softly over his
fevered brow. Had this really been done, or was he deluding himself with
fancies? He opened his eyes, and gazed around. The room was large, and there was
but little furniture in it, but everything was clean and neat. There was a
pleasant paper on the walls, the device being flowers, the colours of which,
though subdued, had some healthful brightness in them. On a table near his bed
were medicine bottles, a basin with soup jelly in it, and a plate of grapes. The
loving care with which he was being nursed was evident whichever way he turned.
There was something more than mere kindness, there was heartfelt devotion, in
these evidences and in what he had lately heard. The woman to whom he owed this
great debt had saved him from death--the doctor had said as much, and Basil did
not doubt that it was true. Whatever could have been her motive he inwardly
acknowledged that she had rendered him a service it would be hard, if not
impossible for him to repay. Saved from death! To what end? That he might live
to clear himself from the foul accusation which hung over him, to avenge
himself, to punish the guilty, perhaps even yet to save Annette. A debt, indeed,
that could never be repaid. Exhausted with thought, he sank into slumber, with a
growing hope in his heart that there might yet be some brightness for him in the
future.</p>

<p class="normal">When he awoke again it was night. Opening his eyes they fell
upon the form of the woman who had tended him. She was kneeling by his bed,
gazing upon his face. A shaded lamp in the room enabled him to see her clearly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Newman!&quot; she said in a low voice of joy, and she half rose
and stretched forth her arms.</p>

<p class="normal">That hated name! Denial was on his lips, but the voice of joy,
the agonized appeal of love expressed in her eyes, arrested his speech. And
indeed at that moment there suddenly flashed upon his mind some glimmering of
the truth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who speaks?&quot; he asked, awed and stricken by the appeal.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your mother, your fond, your loving mother. Oh, my son, don't
break my heart by saying you don't know me! Newman, Newman, my beloved boy, kiss
me, give me one word of love. I shall die, I shall die, if you turn from me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He could not repulse her; he felt that the sentence upon this
loving heart was his to pronounce. Scarcely knowing what he did, he held out his
hands. She seized and kissed them again and again, then fell upon his neck and
pressed him convulsively to her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who are you?&quot; he said softly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your mother, your faithful, faithful mother. Did you not hear
me? Have I spoken too soon? O Newman, Newman, give me one kiss, one kind look.
My poor heart is breaking!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell me who I am,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are our dear, our darling son, whom God in His infinite
mercy has sent back to us, to comfort us, to cheer the little time that remains
to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her mouth was close to his; her quivering lips pleaded for the
kiss for which she yearned. He could not resist her; their lips met; her tears
gushed forth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he said: &quot;I have been ill so long, and my mind
may be wandering still. Is it the truth that I am Newman Chaytor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, my dear, yes, you are the only being left to us on
earth, the only link of love we have. If it distresses you to think, if the
effort is too painful, rest till the morning; I will watch over you. Heaven has
heard my prayers; my darling is restored to me. I can die happy now. The clouds
have passed away; there is nothing but sunshine; your future shall be happy; we
will make it so. Fortune has smiled upon us. Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful--and
just as you have come back to us. But we will not speak of it to-night; we will
wait till to-morrow, when you will be stronger.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, tell me something more--I am strong enough to listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, my poor boy, you have suffered much, you have had great
troubles!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, great and bitter troubles. Bring the lamp nearer. Am I
changed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only a little paler than you used to be and a little thinner.
There is no other change in you. Your father----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My father!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He lives, Newman, he lives, but he is very ill, and I can see
that the doctor fears for him. But he loves you still. Do not think hardly of
him, Newman; he will not be long with us. Say that you forgive him!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What have I to forgive?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There speaks the noble heart of my darling boy. You can bring
peace and comfort to him, as you have brought it to me. You can brighten his
last hours. You will do it, will you not, my dear boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What lies in my power,&quot; said Basil slowly, &quot;to repay you for
your goodness to me, that I will do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was sure of it, I was sure of it. You will find him
changed, Newman; he wanders in his mind sometimes, but you will be gentle with
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes I will be gentle with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We will forget the past--there shall be nothing in our hearts
but love and forgiveness.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Listen a moment. If anybody came to you and said I am not
your son, would you believe him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You ask it to try me, but you little know your mother's
heart. If an angel from heaven were to come and say so, I should not believe
him; I should know it was an evil spirit that spoke. I was going to speak to you
of our good fortune. Shall I go on?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It happened only a week before I met you--O, heaven be
praised for it!--on the bridge. Do you remember, when everything went wrong with
us and we were plunged in poverty, that your father still had some shares in
mining companies left, shares that were supposed not to be worth the paper they
were printed on? Do you remember it, my dear boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is only three weeks ago that a gentleman found out where
we were living--we were very, very poor, Newman--and told us that these shares
were valuable, were worth a great deal of money. Fortunately your father had not
destroyed them, and fortunately, too, when the gentleman called it was on one of
your father's sensible days. He found the shares, and some of them have been
sold. We are now rich--yes, my dear boy, rich. We should never murmur against
heaven's decrees; it was all ordained--that this should happen at the time it
did, and that I should meet you a few days afterwards, in time to save you.
Newman, my dear, you had not a penny in your pockets.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was starving.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My poor boy, my poor, poor boy! Oh, how cruelly we have
treated you!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must not say that. You are the soul of goodness; you have
saved me from death, from despair, from shame, from degradation. I have
something to live for now. Hope revives. I have an enemy who has conspired to
ruin my life. What shall be done to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He must be punished.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He shall be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The monster! To conspire against my dear lad. If I were not
old and weak, I would seek him out myself. He should learn what a mother could
do for a beloved son.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He shall be punished, I say, and his punishment shall come
through those who are nearest to him, and should be dearest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It sounds hard, Newman, but it is just, it is just.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am tired,&quot; said Basil, &quot;I can talk no more; I want to
sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sleep, my dear boy; I will watch by you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, you must seek rest yourself; I insist upon it; it will do
me good to know that you are resting after your long labour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you sure you will not want me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite sure; I am gaining strength rapidly; to-morrow I shall
be almost well. Go.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When did I disobey my dear lad?&quot; said Mrs. Chaytor. &quot;When did
I disregard his slightest wish? He repays me with love, and I am happy, happy!
This is the brightest night of my life, Newman. What have I done that such joy
should be mine? It is more than I deserve. Yes, I will go, though I don't want
rest--indeed, indeed I do not. I could stop up for weeks nursing my dear lad,
and never feel fatigue.&quot; The tears rose in Basil's eyes as he gazed upon her
worn and wasted face. &quot;Good night, my dear, dear boy. God bless and guard you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He could not deny her the kiss for which she mutely pleaded,
and she prepared to leave him; but she came back a dozen times to assure herself
that he was comfortable, that there was not a crease on his pillow, that the
clothes were smoothly laid over him, and to hover about him with soft accents of
love. At length he pretended to be asleep, and she crept from the room so softly
that he did not hear her footfall.</p>

<p class="normal">Being alone now, he could think of what had passed, of the
revelation that had been made to him, of the position in which he stood, and how
it behoved him to act. The woman believed him to be her son, the idol of her
heart, the one supreme treasure which heaven and earth contained for her. In
that belief she had rescued him from death, and by so doing had perhaps afforded
him the opportunity to redeem his name and honour. To undeceive her would break
her heart; of this he had no doubt. How perfect was her love! How tender and
beautiful were its evidences! He remembered his own mother, and knew how pure
was the love which existed between them; but never till this moment had it been
given him to know to what wondrous extent a mother's love could go. That Newman
had been a bad son, that he had been profligate and false--of this he was
certain; such a nature as Newman's was capable of nought else; but all this was
forgotten and forgiven. Nay, instead of entreaties for pardon being expected
from him, it was himself that was asked to forgive. Something more than
gratitude stirred his heart as he thought of Mrs. Chaytor's goodness, a feeling
of pity and affection rose within him, and he bethought himself in what way he
could repay her for the great service she had rendered to him.</p>

<p class="normal">Had it been Newman, indeed, whom she had rescued from death
and dishonour, how would he have acted? Natures do not change, and Newman would
have followed the bent of his. He would have brought fresh sorrows upon her
head; he would have stripped her of her new fortune and squandered it in
dissolute practices? Would it not be a fine revenge to make the end of her life
sweet and beautiful by the loving care and gratitude it was in Basil's power to
bestow. His heart glowed at the thought. The sterner part of his revenge could
still be carried out. He would have means to prosecute his search for Newman and
Annette, and it would be the easiest matter to find an excuse for absence, if it
were necessary that he should go personally to seek them. Thus two good ends
would be attained, one certain in the joy it would bring to a good woman's
heart, the other as yet uncertain, inasmuch as the roads which would lead to it
were enveloped in darkness.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, he would have means to punish the guilty. But were those
means his to use? Could he with justice employ them in the task upon which he
was engaged, and which Mrs. Chaytor had saved him to prosecute? This was the
question which now obtruded itself.</p>

<p class="normal">Why not? Had not Newman Chaytor, by the vilest conduct, by
long systematic deceit and treachery, fraudulently obtained possession of his
fortune, and was he not now using it for his own selfish pleasures? Could human
cunning go further than Newman had done in his vile plot--could human baseness
reach a baser depth? No. There would be a strange and inscrutable justice in
using the villain's weapons to bring the villain to bay.</p>

<p class="normal">There was another consideration: Annette. If in the morning he
declared himself to be Basil Whittingham, if he left the loving mother in sorrow
and tribulation, and rejected the opportunity which, through no scheming on his
part, had presented itself, if he threw himself once more penniless upon the
world, what chance had he of finding Annette in time, maybe, to save her from a
life of deepest unhappiness? This last consideration induced him to resolve upon
his course of action. For the present he would allow matters to go on as they
would. He would not undeceive Mrs. Chaytor; she should, for as long or as short
a time as circumstances permitted, rest in a delusion which had filled her heart
with joy. She should believe that he, Basil, was her son indeed, and he would
work and wait for events.</p>

<p class="normal">But he would be strictly just, as far as he could. What money
he used should be used to one end, and to one end only; unless, indeed (and a
strange smile wreathed his lips as this view presented itself) collateral
disclosures were revealed to him of Newman Chaytor's home life of villainy and
treachery which pleaded for some kind of compensation. Then would he use some of
Chaytor's money to repair the wrong. A devious road to justice, but a
justifiable one. Having thus determined, sleep descended upon him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_32" href="#div1Ref_32">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Early the next morning he awoke. The sun was shining into the
room, and he was alone. There was some kind of stir in the house for which he
could not account, and the cause of which he was curious to ascertain. Feeling
that his strength had returned to him he rose from the bed, and although a
natural weakness was upon him, he succeeded in partially dressing himself. While
thus employed the door was opened and the doctor entered the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;as I expected. You are yourself
again.&quot; He was a young man, and had a cheery voice and manner, which, used with
discretion, and not allowed to become too bluff, are invaluable aids to a
medical practitioner.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am almost well, I think,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But we must be careful,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;we must husband
our strength. You have a good constitution, and that has served you.&quot; Although
his voice was cheerful, he spoke with a certain reserve.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you not here very early?&quot; asked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am,&quot; replied the doctor, &quot;much earlier than usual. The fact
is I was called in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are too anxious about me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, yes, but I was not called in to see you. Your parents
required me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For themselves?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For themselves. Are you strong enough to hear some grave
news?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me know it, quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To be plain, your good mother has overtaxed herself; and your
father's illness has taken a serious turn. Your mother did not wish me to tell
you; she asked me to think of some excuse why she could not come to you; but in
the circumstances the truth is best.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, the truth is best. Disguise nothing from me. See--I am
really strong and well.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will do, if you are careful. As I said, your mother has
overtaxed her strength, and she is now suffering from it. I warned her a score
of times, but she would not leave your side, it is wonderful the devotion of
these good women.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it anything serious?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I fear so; she is old, and seems to have gone through some
serious troubles.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will go and see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not till you have breakfast. I have ordered it for you, and
if you will allow me, I will join you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are very welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The maid entered the room with a tray, which she placed on a
table; the doctor threw open the window, saying, &quot;Nothing like fresh air. Come,
let us fall to.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil was much taken with him; he was a man of culture and
refinement, and knew what he was about. As they proceeded with their breakfast
he entertained Basil with light and agreeable conversation, and it was only when
the meal was finished that he reverted to the subject of his professional visit.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Has your mother,&quot; he inquired, &quot;during late years endured
privation?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have been absent from England for a great many years,&quot;
replied Basil evasively.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And if she had,&quot; continued the doctor, &quot;she would conceal it
from you! it is in the nature of such women. But I am led to this belief by her
condition; it is not only that she is suffering from the reaction of overtaxed
endurance, but that she has no reserve strength to draw upon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was clear to Basil that he believed her case to be serious,
and in great anxiety he accompanied the doctor to the sickroom. There were two
beds in the room, one occupied by Mrs. Chaytor, the other by her husband. Mr.
Chaytor was dozing, and Basil, gazing upon him, saw a white and wasted face,
long drawn and thin as that of a man whose sands of life were fast running out.
Mrs. Chaytor cast a look of reproach upon the doctor, as she murmured:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You should not have told him, you should not have told him!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was up and dressed, my dear lady,&quot; said the doctor softly,
&quot;when I went in to see him. You must trust me to do what's best for all of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, I will,&quot; murmured Mrs. Chaytor. &quot;You have restored my
dear son to health. O, Newman, Newman!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil bent over her, and kissed her; she tried to rise, but
had not strength.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How good you are, how good, how good!&quot; she sobbed.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil was shocked at her appearance, which had undergone a sad
change since the previous evening. The faithful couple, after a long and anxious
life, seemed to be both waiting for the summons from the angel of death.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is my turn now to nurse you,&quot; said Basil, pityingly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, you must not; the kind doctor has sent for a nurse; you
must take care of yourself. There is a long and happy life before you, and you
must not waste your days upon old people like us. Are your father's eyes
closed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He wishes to speak to you when he wakes. He is quite
sensible, and has something to say to you. Doctor, I must speak to my son
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was about to forbid any serious conversation, but, looking
attentively at her, he did not speak the words that came to his lips. He nodded,
and beckoned to Basil, who joined him at the door of the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am going now,&quot; he said, &quot;and shall return at noon. Do not
let your mother exhaust herself. If she speaks excitedly, calm her down and beg
her, for your sake--it is the appeal that will have the best effect upon her--to
speak more slowly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But had she not better wait till she is stronger?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The doctor gazed at him with serious eyes, &quot;It will perhaps be
as well not to wait. She seems to have something of importance to communicate to
your By-and-bye may be too late?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Inexpressively grieved, Basil returned to the bedside, and
took Mrs. Chaytor's thin hand in his; her fingers clung to his convulsively.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must speak to you about your father,&quot; she said, and to save
her the effort of raising her voice, Basil laid his head on the pillow close to
her mouth. A beautiful smile came to her lips as he did so. &quot;Always loving and
considerate!&quot; she murmured. &quot;Always the same tender and unselfish lad! Newman,
your father has not seen you yet; all the time you were lying ill he has been
unable to rise from his bed. Don't contradict him, my dear lad.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will not,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has strange fancies; he was always strange--but he has
been good to me. Remember that, Newman, and bear with him for my sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you, my dear boy. If he says anything about the past,
listen in silence--even if it is hard to hear, listen in silence. He was not so
considerate of you as he might have been, but we can't alter our natures, can
we, my darling? He could never see that young people love pleasure, and ought to
have it; he wanted you to be grave and serious, as he was, and he would not make
excuses for little faults. Bear that in mind, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He said to me, 'I shall speak to Newman plainly,' and I know
what that means. He may speak harsh words, but you will be prepared for them. He
loves you in his heart, indeed he does, and intends to behave rightly to you.
Yesterday he wrote a paper, which I think he will give you, and something else
with it--something that will make your life easy and happy. You need never want
again, my dear boy, never, never. Oh, how you must have suffered! And you were
starving, and were too proud to come to us, who would have shared our last crust
with you. Let me tell you about our fortune, Newman. When some cheques were
brought to your father for the shares, he would not take them: he would take
nothing but notes and gold; and the money was brought to him, and he has it now
under his bed. 'If I put it into a bank,' he said, 'it will break, and I shall
be ruined again. I will keep it always by me in cash.' I told him it wasn't
safe, that we were old and might be robbed, but he would not listen to me. He
was always self-willed, you must remember that; he would always have his way,
and never thought that anyone was right but himself. I don't know how much money
he has, but it must be thousands of pounds. He gave me a hundred pounds in gold
to pay the house expenses; I have only spent forty, and there is sixty left.
Here it is--take it, Newman; take it, my dear boy. If you love me don't refuse.
That's right, put it in your pocket; all we have belongs to you--every farthing.
'When you want more,' he said to me, 'ask me for it and you shall have it.' He
was never niggardly, I will say that of him; we had a beautiful home once, did
we not? How happy you made it when you were little--and when you were big, too,
my dear! One day, when you are married--I hope you will marry a good woman, who
will love you with all her heart, and appreciate you--you will find out how
happy a little child can make a home. Then you will think of me, will you
not?--then you will know better what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her breath was spent, and she could not continue. She closed
her eyes, but her fingers tightened upon Basil's, and presently she began to
babble incoherently. The entrance of the nurse who had been sent her was a
welcome relief to Basil; the woman had received her instructions, and she went
about her duties noiselessly. Mrs. Chaytor's grasp relaxed, and Basil removed
his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You had best go,&quot; whispered the nurse; &quot;she wants sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil obeyed, and in his own room applied himself again to a
review of his position. Strange indeed were the circumstances in which he found
himself, but he saw no other course to pursue than that upon which he had
already resolved. At noon the doctor called again, and his report was even less
hopeful than on his previous visit.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can do nothing, I fear,&quot; he said; &quot;the end is approaching.
You must be prepared.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is there no hope for one?&quot; asked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For neither, so far as my judgment is to be trusted. It would
be a satisfaction to you, perhaps, if a physician were called in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think it should be done,&quot; said Basil, &quot;but I am a stranger
here and know no one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will come at five o'clock, and bring a physician with me.
Meanwhile, if your parents have any arrangements to make with respect to
property, it should not be neglected. I am of the opinion that your father will
have an interval of consciousness this evening, and then would be the proper
time. In everything else you may trust the nurse I have sent in; she understands
the cases thoroughly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The physician's statement verified the warning.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Their vital forces are spent,&quot; he said; &quot;the end cannot be
averted or arrested.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was at eight o'clock that the nurse presented herself, and
told him that his father had asked for him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your mother is sleeping,&quot; she said; &quot;speak as softly as you
can.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He followed her to the room and took a chair by Mr. Chaytor's
bed. He had strange thoughts as he entered. Suppose that Mr. Chaytor, seeing him
for the first time should refuse to see the likeness to Newman which others had
seen? In that case, how should he act? He was puzzled to answer, and, driven by
circumstances into a position he had not sought, could but leave events to take
their course, which they had already done independent of himself. But nothing of
the sort happened. Mr. Chaytor's eyes dwelt upon his face, and then he called
Basil by the name of Newman, and Basil had no alternative but to answer to it.
The nurse sat discreetly by Mrs. Chaytor's side.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Send that woman away,&quot; said Mr. Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">His words came with difficulty; his voice was choked. The
nurse heard the demand, and as she passed from the room she whispered to Basil
that she would be ready outside if he wanted her. For several minutes there was
silence, a silence which Basil did not venture to break. Mr. Chaytor appeared to
be engaged in the effort of marshalling his thoughts.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have come back in time,&quot; he said, &quot;to see me die.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I trust there is still hope,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is no hope,&quot; said the sick man. &quot;The doctors spoke
together under their breath, and thought I could not hear. They were wrong; I
heard every word they said. The fools forgot that a dying man's senses are often
preternaturally sharpened. Mine were, 'He will die at sunrise,' they said. Very
well. I shall die at sunrise. Oh, I don't dispute them; they know their
business. Sunrise is some hours yet; I have time to speak, and I mean to keep my
wits together till I have said what I have got to say. What you have to do is to
listen. Do you hear me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hear you,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't intend,&quot; continued the dying man, &quot;to ask you
questions, for I know what kind of replies you would give. What you are, you
are, and of that I have had bitter experience. Your mother, lying there at the
point of death--Oh, I heard that, too, when they were putting their heads
together--believes in you, trusts you, thinks you the sun, moon, and stars all
rolled into one, and thinks me a black cloud whose only aim is to tarnish your
brightness. Let her believe so. There was never any reason or any wisdom in her
love; but she is a good woman. To him she loves she gives all, and asks for
nothing in return. Whom she trusts is immaculate; she cannot see a spot upon
him. That is how it stands, how it has always stood, between you and her. It is
different with me. Ever since you became a man--heaven pardon me for calling you
one!--you have been corrupt and vicious; and I knew it. Ever since you became a
man you have been false to friendship, false to love; and I knew it. Ever since
you became a man you have had but one idea--yourself, your vanities, your
degraded pleasures, your low and envious desires; and I knew it. Why, then,
should I ask you questions, knowing you would lie to me in your answers. For you
are as glib of speech, Newman Chaytor, as you are cunning of mind. You have been
absent from us a long time: doubtless you have a good recollection of the day on
which I turned you from my house. We became stricken down; we became worse than
poor; we became paupers. Your mother wrote to you when you were on the
goldfields, and you sent back whining letters of your misfortunes. Your mother
believed you and pitied you; I disbelieved you and despised you. At length you
came home, and hunting for us to see whether there was another drop of blood you
could suck from our empty veins, discovered that you could hope for nothing from
us, and therefore kept aloof; for it is a fact that until a week previous to
your mother meeting you on Westminster Bridge, we lived on beggary and charity.
How do I arrive at this knowledge of your movements? From intuition, from the
bitter experiences with which you supplied me. I must pause a little. I will
proceed in a minute or two, when I get back my treacherous voice. Do not poison
the silence with your voice. I prefer not to hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was dreadful to hear him. The choked utterances, the pauses
between the words, the fixed determination to say what was in his mind, the
stern tones, produced a painful impression upon Basil; but he had perforce to
obey, and so he waited till the dying man resumed:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you had heard of my good fortune you would have leapt upon
us like a wolf; but it did not reach your ears. Therefore you kept away from us,
fearing, while you had one penny left, that we should beg a halfpenny of it.
Your mother brought you home--not to these rooms at first, for we had not
removed from our old quarters, but afterwards we came here for your pleasure.
Well, for hers, too, perhaps,&quot;--his eyes softened a little as he turned them
towards the bed in which Mrs. Chaytor lay--&quot;and she was happy, for the first
time for many, many years, because you were with us. I could not come to see
you; it is eight months since I was able to crawl, but your mother gave me
accounts of you, and I was not displeased that she was able to nurse you into
strength. She has hastened her end through it, but that matters little to her.
During this last week I have been thinking what I should do with my money, and I
have allowed myself to be persuaded, most likely beguiled. Look beneath my bed;
you will see a cashbox; bring it forth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil did as he was directed, and produced the cashbox.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It contains a portion of my wealth; there are some shares in
it which may yet be valuable. I have made no will, but I give you the cashbox
and the contents while I live; they are yours--a free gift. Beneath my bed,
between the mattresses, is a larger sum which you may take possession of when I
am gone; I make no disposition of it, and you may act as you please in regard to
it. Take the key of the cashbox--it is hanging there, at the head of the bed;
and I lay this injunction upon you, that you do not open the box until I am
dead. In this I must break through the rule I laid down when I began to speak.
You will obey me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will obey you,&quot; said Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a solemn promise?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a solemn promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is a look in your face I have never seen there before.
Is it possible that a change has come over you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have none but kind and grateful thoughts for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it true. <i>Can</i> it be true?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is true.&quot; Then, like a whirlwind, there rushed upon
Basil's mind a torrent of self-reproach. Was it right that he should allow the
dying man to rest in his delusion? Was it not incumbent upon him that he should
confess, here and now, that he was not Newman Chaytor? Whatever the
consequences, was it not his duty to brave them? But before he could speak a
word to this effect Mr. Chaytor raised himself in his bed with a terrible cry;
and at that cry the nurse unceremoniously entered the room, and caught Mr.
Chaytor in her arms. A little froth gathered about his lips, his head tossed
this way and that; then movement ceased; his limbs relaxed, and the nurse laid
him back in bed. Awe-stricken, Basil whispered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is he dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said the nurse; &quot;if any change occurs I will call you.
Go--I can attend better to him alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can I not assist you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, you will be in my way. Hush! Go at once; your mother is
stirring. Be sure I will call you, I promise faithfully.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil left the room, carrying the cashbox with him, which he
placed under his own bed, putting the key in his pocket. He did not seek rest,
his mind was too perturbed. Towards midnight the doctor called in, and gently
informed Basil that within a few hours he would lose both his parents.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In one sense,&quot; he said, &quot;apart from the grief which such a
loss bears with it, it is a happy fitness that two old people, who have lived a
long life in harmony with each other, should pass away at the same time, the
allotted span of existence having been reached. I sympathise sincerely with
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil gave him a strange look; so completely was his position
recognised and established that he almost doubted his identity. It wanted a few
minutes to sunrise when the nurse came to the door and solemnly beckoned to him.
He followed her it silence; she pointed first to the bed in which Mr. Chaytor
lay. The form thereon was grey and motionless.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He died in his sleep,&quot; whispered the nurse; &quot;not a sound
escaped him. It was a happy, painless death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil gazed at the still form.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now you know,&quot; he thought. &quot;Forgive me for the deception
which has been forced upon me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The nurse touched his arm, and directed his attention to Mrs.
Chaytor, saying softly, &quot;I would not let her know of your father's death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Newman, Newman, my dear boy,&quot; murmured the dying woman, &quot;put
your lips to mine; come closer to me, closer, closer. My last thoughts, my last
prayers are for you. Has your father spoken to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And has he given you what he promised?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then all is well. We shall trouble you no more, my darling. A
life of happiness is before you. Think of us sometimes; and if your father does
not get well, lay us in the same grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall wait for you in heaven. How happy I am--how happy,
how happy! I am not sorry to go now I have found you. I have prayed to die like
this. God has been very good to me. He has answered my prayer. Kiss me, dear.
God bless and guard you!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She said no more; before the next hour struck her spirit was
in another world.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Remain with them,&quot; Basil said to the nurse, &quot;and let
everything be done that is proper and necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He gave her some money, and oppressed with thought, returned
to his chamber. No adventure that he had met with in the course of his chequered
life had stirred him so deeply as this. So strange and singular was it that he
might have been pardoned for doubting still that it was true. But the cashbox,
which he had drawn from beneath the bed, was before him; the key was in his
hand.</p>

<p class="normal">After a brief space he opened the box, taking the precaution
first to lock his door. Upon the top of the box were eight acceptances for
various amounts, signed in different names, some in those of Mr. Chaytor, others
in names that were strange to him. They were pinned together, and folded in a
paper upon which was written:</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;These acceptances are forgeries, committed by my son, Newman
Chaytor. I have paid them, and saved him from the just punishment which should
have been his. In this and in other ways he has ruined my career, and brought
his mother and me to direst poverty. But although the money is paid and the
exposure averted, the crime remains; he is not cleared of it. It is a stain upon
him for ever.--Edward Chaytor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Beneath these documents was another, inscribed:</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;The last words of Edward Chaytor, once a prosperous
gentleman, but brought to shame by a guilty son.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Unfolding the paper, Basil read:</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;To my son Newman Chaytor, a man of sin, I, his unhappy
father, address these words. Your life has been a life of infamy, and you, who
should have been a blessing to us, have plunged us in misery. I have little hope
of your future, but remorse may prompt you to pay heed to what I now say. Repent
of your evil courses while there is time. You may live to be old, when
repentance will be too late. If there is any wrong to be righted, which may be
righted by money, seek it out, and let my money right it. If there is any
atonement to be made, and you see a way to it--as you surely will if you
try--let my money atone for it. If there is any villainy committed by you which
merits punishment, but which in some small measure may be condoned by money, let
my money accomplish it. Do this, and you may hope for forgiveness. I could write
much more, but I have neither the desire nor the power; but if I wrote for a
week you would not have a better understanding of my meaning. Signed on my
death-bed. Your father,</p>

<p style="text-indent:55%">&quot;<span class="sc">Edward Chaytor</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">The remaining contents of the cashbox were gold and notes,
amounting in all to a considerable sum. Basil counted the money, made a careful
and exact record of it on a fair sheet of paper, replaced the papers and locked
the box, and put it in a place of safety.</p>

<p class="normal">He was not long in arriving at a decision as to what he should
do with respect to this money. For his own needs he would use the barest
pittance upon which he could live, and some part of the money he would also use
in the prosecution of his search for Newman Chaytor and Annette. In this
expenditure he felt himself justified, and he would keep a strict and faithful
account of the sums he expended. For the rest, if anything in the career of
Newman Chaytor came to his knowledge, and he could in any way carry out the
behests of the man lying dead in the room beyond, he would do it, and thus
vicariously make atonement for the villain who had brought sorrow and misery
upon all with whom he came in contact. For the present there were duties which
demanded his attention, and Basil applied himself to the last sad offices
towards those who had passed away. In the course of the week his task was
accomplished. Mr. and Mrs. Chaytor lay in one grave, and Basil made arrangements
for a stone, and for a continual supply of fresh flowers over the grave. Then,
with a stern resolve, he set himself to the serious work before him, and to the
design which had brought him home from the goldfields.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_33" href="#div1Ref_33">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">The first thing he did was to remove from the house which had
been occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Chaytor, and take a room in a poor locality, for
which he paid four shillings a week. Including this sum he thought he could live
as well as he desired upon a pound a week. He experienced a grim satisfaction
from the reflection that he was expending upon his own personal necessities some
small portion of the fortune of which Newman Chaytor had so successfully robbed
him. If the day ever arrived when it would be necessary to go into accounts with
Newman Chaytor this slight expenditure would be placed to the villain's credit.
He had an idea of returning to his lodgings in Mrs. Philpott's house, the
assistance of whose husband he determined again to seek, but upon second
thoughts he saw that he would be more free to act if he were not under the
kindly surveillance of this estimable couple. Having established himself in his
new quarters he went direct to Mrs. Philpott's residence in Lambeth. The woman
was overjoyed to see him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, sir, why,&quot; she cried, as she came to the door fresh from
the washing-tub wiping the suds from her arms, &quot;this <i>is</i> a pleasure.
Philpott will be more than glad. Here, children, children! Come and see an old
friend; there never was such a favourite with them as you were, sir. They have
been continually taking you into custody and locking you up, and trying and
acquitting you, without a stain on your character.&quot; Mrs. Philpott laughed. &quot;You
mustn't mind ways; if they didn't think all the world of you they'd give you six
months hard labour. It's the revenge they take upon people they don't like.
Don't crowd round the gentleman so, you rude things! Where's your manners, I
should like to know? Won't you walk in, sir? I hope you're coming back to live
with us; there's your room waiting for you; it's never been occupied, and
Philpott says it never shall be, unless you take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am living elsewhere, Mrs. Philpott,&quot; said Basil, &quot;but I've
come to see your husband on business.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm sorry he's not in, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Philpott; &quot;he won't be
home till ten o'clock to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can I see him, then; my business will not admit of delay?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Certainly, sir. Philpott would get up in the middle of the
night to serve you, and so would I. You'll stop and have a bite with us, sir, I
hope?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, thank you, I haven't time; I will be here punctually at
ten.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Philpott, regretfully, &quot;if you must go;
but you'll take a bit of supper with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, with pleasure. Your husband is sure to be at home, I
suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir; Philpott's the soul of punctuality. He's gone for a
day in the country to see an old friend, and his train is due at Victoria at
twenty past nine. You're looking better than you did, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am better, and in better spirits.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you remember what I said, sir, about clouds with silver
linings? Lord Sir! When things are at their worst they're sure to mend. What men
and women have got to do is never to give in. Oh, I've had my lessons, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So have I, Mrs. Philpott: I shall be with you at ten.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Patting the children on their heads, and giving them a penny
each--he felt like a shilling, but it was not exactly his own money he was
spending, and this small benefaction was a luxury which did not properly come
under the head of personal expenses--Basil, with pleasant nods, left them to
their favourite occupation of taking people up and trying them for imaginary
offences against the public peace. At nightfall, having an idle hour or two
before his appointment with Mr. Philpott, an impulse which he made no effort to
control directed his steps towards Long Acre, and then to Queen Street, where
the woman whom Newman Chaytor had betrayed and deserted carried on her business.
The workgirls from the large establishments in the vicinity of the street were
coming from their shops, most of them in blithe spirits, being young and in
agreeable employment. It was the holiday time of the day with them, and they
were hurrying home, some doing a little sweet-hearting on the road which it was
pleasant to contemplate. There were pictures not so pleasant; great hulking men
smoking pipes and lounging about, with &quot;Brute&quot; stamped on their features, and
women as coarse, whose birth and training perhaps were a legitimate answer to
their worse than common language and manners. Basil's observations of London
life during the last few months had supplied him with ample food for reflection,
and he could honestly have preached a homily on charity which better men than
he--say, for instance, philanthropists or statesmen with hobbies--might
serviceably have taken to heart.</p>

<p class="normal">His attention was diverted from these unfortunates by a
startling incident. There was a sudden cry of &quot;Fire!&quot; and the thoroughfare
became instantly thronged.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where is it?--where is it?&quot; &quot;There, you fool! Can't you see
it?--in Queen Street.&quot; &quot;It's a private house.&quot; &quot;No, it isn't, it's a shop--a
milliner's. An old house; it'll burn like tinder.&quot; &quot;A good job it isn't in the
middle of the night; they'd have been burnt in their beds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The sparks rushed up in fierce exultation. &quot;The next house is
caught! The whole street 'll be down. Here's the fire-engine!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In gallant haste the horses tore along, the brave firemen,
heroes one and all, standing firm and ready. Basil followed the crowd, and with
difficulty pushed his way through as far as he was allowed. It was Mrs.
Addison's shop that was on fire, and he saw immediately that there was no chance
of saving it. The weeping women were outside, wringing their hands; among them
the woman who had accused him, and her mother, who had cast upon him that ever
vivid look of abhorrence and hatred. So quick and sudden and fierce was the fire
that not a stick of furniture nor a yard of ribbon was saved. The women strove
to rush into the shop, but the firemen held them back, and with firm kindness
impelled them to a place of safety. Basil, edging near to them, and keeping his
face hidden, heard what passed between. &quot;We are ruined,&quot; said one, despairingly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Aren't you insured?&quot; inquired a by-stander.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not for a penny,&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, you'll have to commence the world all over again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Heaven help us!&quot; was the answer. &quot;We are worse than naked; we
owe money.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never mind, old woman,&quot; shouted a tipsy man, &quot;there's the
work'us open.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shut up, you brute!&quot; cried an indignant female. &quot;Have you no
bowels?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At the words, &quot;We are ruined,&quot; a thrill shot through Basil.
Here was a woman whom Newman Chaytor had wronged; here was a woman to whom
atonement was due. He knew what it was right should be done, and he determined
to do it. He lingered near them until the shop lay a mouldering heap of ruins;
he heard a kind neighbour offer them lodging for the night; he marked the house
they entered; and then he went home to his own lodging of one room. There,
safely concealed, was a sum of money amounting to three hundred pounds; he took
the whole of it, wrote on a sheet of paper, &quot;In partial atonement of wrong
committed in the past,&quot; and put the paper and the notes in an envelope, which he
addressed to Mrs. Addison. Then he went to Mrs. Philpott's house. &quot;You are late,
sir,&quot; said that cheerful woman; &quot;an hour behind time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have been detained.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're not too late for supper, sir, at all events,&quot; said
Mrs. Philpott; &quot;I put it back for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must excuse me,&quot; said Basil; &quot;something of pressing
importance has occurred, and I want Mr. Philpott to come out with me
immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite ready, sir,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, rising and getting his
hat.</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Philpott, recognising that the business was urgent, did
not press Basil further, although disappointment was in her face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At another time,&quot; said Basil, &quot;I shall be glad to accept of
your hospitality. Come, Mr. Philpott.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As they walked on Basil explained that he wished Mr. Philpott
to take up the dropped threads of the search for Newman Chaytor, and then he
explained what he wished to do at the present moment.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is purely a confidential matter,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and is not
to be spoken of in any way after the commission is executed. Here is the house.
Some women are lodging here for the night whose place of business near Long Acre
has been burnt down. You will ask for Mrs. Addison; if a mother and her daughter
present themselves it is the daughter you must address. Ask her if she is the
woman who has been burnt out, and if she answers in the affirmative give her
this envelope, and come away at once. If she seeks to detain you and asks
questions, do not answer them. I will wait for you on the opposite side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He watched Mr. Philpott execute the commission, being right in
his conjecture that the women would be too excited to seek their beds until late
in the night. The woman with whom he had the interview appeared at the door, and
received the envelope; after which Mr. Philpott joined him, as directed. At the
corner of the street Basil and his companion paused and looked back at the
house. In a few moments the woman who had answered Mr. Philpott's summons came
quickly to the street door and looked eagerly up and down; Basil and Mr.
Philpott were standing in the shadow, and could not be seen. The light of the
street lamp assisted Basil to see her face: it was radiant with joy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A good night's work,&quot; said Basil, taking Mr. Philpott's arm
and walking away. &quot;I will call upon you to-morrow. Good night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Philpott left him and proceeded homewards, as did Basil.
He did not know that a man was following him with eager curiosity. He put his
latchkey in the street door of his lodging, and as he did so the man touched his
arm. Basil turned.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What, Old Corrie!&quot; he cried, in a voice of delight.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No other,&quot; said Old Corrie, calmly. &quot;It <i>is</i> Master
Basil. I thought I wasn't mistaken. Well, well! This is a meeting to be thankful
for. I'm in luck.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_34" href="#div1Ref_34">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come in, come in,&quot; said Basil, clutching Old Corrie by the
arm, as though he feared to lose him, and dragging him into the house; &quot;this is
indeed a meeting to be thanking for. It is I who am in luck.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He regarded it as an omen of good fortune. If Old Corrie were
thus unexpectedly found, why not Newman Chaytor? And, besides, here was a trusty
friend upon whom he could rely--here was a man whose evidence would go far to
establish his identity, to restore his good name, to give the lie to his
traducers. He looked upon this meeting as the opening of a brighter chapter in
his strange career, and with this cheering thought in his mind he ascended the
stairs to his one room at the top of the house, still keeping tight hold of
Corrie, who, accompanied him, willingly enough, in a kind of amazed silence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must find a candle,&quot; said Basil, pushing Old Corrie, into
the room before him. &quot;You won't run away, Corrie?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No fear, Master Basil,&quot; replied Corrie. &quot;I am not in a
run-away humour. Shouldn't wonder, supposing I get encouragement, if I develop
the qualities of a leech.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I promise you encouragement enough,&quot; said Basil, with a
little laugh. His spirits were almost joyous; youth seemed to be returning to
him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wait for proof,&quot; observed Corrie sententiously. &quot;Friends
are none so plentiful in this hard world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;True, true,&quot; assented Basil, groping about for a candle. &quot;You
could swear to me in the dark, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If needful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's more than some would do in the full light of the
blessed sun. I could sing for joy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hold your hand, Master Basil; let us exchange a few more
words in darkness. I am speculating whether you are changed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you think, Corrie?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think not, but what man can be sure? I have been sore beset
since we last talked together.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We have been rowing in the same boat, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have met with misfortunes, too! Have they soured you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They have brought sorrow and doubt in their train, but, there
is sweetness still in the world. This meeting is a proof.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You live high up, and the house is the house of poor people.
Birds of a feather flock together. Perhaps, after all, I had best go away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you attempt it I shall assault you. Corrie, old friend,
you have dropped upon me like a messenger from Heaven. Here is the candle at
last. Now we can have a good look at each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They gazed in silence for a few moments, and Basil was grieved
to see old Corrie in rags. Beneath the bluff honesty of his face there were
undeniable marks of privation, but despite these signs there was a gleam of
humour still in his eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, Master Basil?&quot; said he presently.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am truly sorry, dear old friend,&quot; said Basil, holding out
his hand. &quot;You have had some hard knocks.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You may say that. It has been a case of battledore and
shuttlecock--the battledore a stone one and the shuttlecock a poor bit of
ironbark, with such a mockery of feathers in it that the moment it was knocked
up it fell down like a lump of lead. If I puzzle you, Master Basil, you puzzle
me. There is something in you I can't exactly read. Your clothes are not what I
should like to see you wear, though they are the clothes of a prince compared
with mine. This room is the room of a man pretty low down in the world,&quot; and
here Old Corrie added with a laugh, &quot;the higher up you live the lower down you
are--and yet you have the air of a man who is not hard up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Regarding me,&quot; said Basil, &quot;as a bundle of contradictions,
you are nearer the mark than you could suppose yourself to be. But surely I am
forgetting my manners and my duties as a host.&quot; He opened a cupboard, and drew
therefrom bread, butter, cheese, and a bottle of ale, which he uncorked. Plates,
glasses, and knives were on the table in a trice. &quot;Fall to, Corrie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can spare it, Master Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can spare it, Corrie. You share with me from this time
forth. Do you live near here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very near,&quot; replied Old Corrie, pointing to the window. &quot;The
sky is my roof.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It has been mine. We'll house you better. I drink love and
friendship to a dear old friend.&quot; They clinked glasses, and Corrie ate like a
famished man. The meal being done he said: &quot;I've been on my beam-ends in
Australia, but starving in this country is a very different pair of shoes. It's
a near thing here between want and death--so near that they touch often and join
hands in grim partnership. I've seen it done, and a dead woman before me. Now,
in Australia, unless it comes to being lost in a bush--where it's no man's fault
but the explorer's--I never heard of a case. There's stone-breaking at all
events to tide over the evil day. I've had more than one turn at it, and been
thankful to get it to do, as every honest and willing man would be. Different in
England, Master Basil, where they've brought civilization down to a fine point.
Did you take notice how I ate my supper? More like a wild beast than a man--and
now, with a full stomach, I am thoroughly ashamed of myself. Not that I am loth
to accept your hospitality; it's the need of it that riles me. That's where the
shoe really pinches.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can sympathise with you, Corrie. By the way, I am in your
debt.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How so, Master Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Over the water yonder, I borrowed a mare of you, and managed
to lose it. You remember. I wanted to get from Bidaud's plantation to Gum Flat
Township--a gruesome journey it turned out to be--and you lent me your mare.
When I returned and reported the matter to you my pockets were empty, and not a
word of reproach did you fling at me. I couldn't pay the debt then--I can now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hold hard a bit, Master Basil; let me turn the thing over in
my mind.&quot; Basil humoured him, and there was a brief silence. Then Corrie said,
&quot;It is a simple justice that the mare should be paid for if you can afford it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can afford it. Why, if I had my own this night I should be
worth sixty thousand pounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Some one has cheated you, Master Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;More than cheated me; has done me the foulest wrong. You
shall hear all by-and-by. But I still have money I can call my own. The robber,
unknown to himself, is making restitution by driblets. Here you are, Corrie.&quot; He
had counted out thirty pounds, which he now pushed over to Corrie across the
table. Corrie counted it, but did not take it up.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If this is for the mare, Master Basil, it's too much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Too little, you mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Too much by twenty pounds. The old mare <i>might</i> have
fetched a ten pound note in a sale-yard, and more likely than not would have
been knocked down for a fiver. So I'll take ten, if you don't mind, Master
Basil, and we'll cry quits on that account. I wouldn't take that if my pockets
weren't empty.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">No persuasion on Basil's part could induce Old Corrie to
accept more than the ten pounds, and the young man was fain to yield.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You were quite in earnest,&quot; said Old Corrie, &quot;when you
offered to give me a shakedown for the night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've a mind to be angry with you,&quot; responded Basil, &quot;for
asking the question. Let us settle matters between us once and for all, Corrie.
You had a good opinion of me once.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I had, Master Basil, and would have done much to serve you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You did do much--more than I had any right to expect, more
than any other man did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not more than any other man would have done,&quot; said Old
Corrie, eyeing Basil attentively, &quot;if he had lived.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You refer to Anthony Bidaud?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do. I haven't forgotten him, nor little lady, nor that
skunk of an uncle of hers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We have much to talk over, you and I,&quot; said Basil,
restraining the impulse to speak immediately of Annette, &quot;but what is between us
must first be settled and clearly understood. You are right about Anthony
Bidaud. He would have been the first, but he died before his intentions could be
fulfilled. Next to him you stand, and surely you would not have been the friend
you were to me if you had not esteemed and trusted me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That goes without saying.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As I was then, Corrie,&quot; continued Basil, earnestly, &quot;so I am
now. I have passed through the fire, and suffering may still await me, but I am
and hope to remain, unchanged. Let us take up the thread Of friendship where it
was broken off, on the goldfields, when Newman Chaytor and I were working
together and when you endeavoured to persuade me to come home with you. Ah, what
might I have been spared had I accepted your generous offer! Corrie, if ever
there was a time in my life when I most needed a true friend, it is now. There
is vital work before me to do, and you, and you alone, can help me. By Heavens,
if you desert me I doubt whether I should be able to prove that I am I! Come,
old friend, say that you will believe in me as of old, and that you will stick
by me as you would have done in the old Australian days.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Say no more,&quot; said Old Corrie. &quot;I'll worry you no longer;
it's scarcely fair play, for, Master Basil, I never doubted you in reality; but
poverty is proud and suspicious, and often behaves like an ill-trained
watch-dog. And besides, there are times in some men's lives when kindness is so
rare and unexpected that it throws them off their balance. I don't pretend to
understand half you have said about yourself, but I'll wait till you explain,
and then if I can help you in any way, here I am, ready. I am wondering whether
something that happened to me would be of interest to you--but, no, it is a
foolish thought. Doubtless you have seen her, and now I come to think of it,
perhaps there lies part of your trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Seen whom?&quot; asked Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Little lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; cried Basil, in great excitement, &quot;I have not seen her,
and I would give the best years of my life to find her. You know where she is;
you can take me to her!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Steady, lad, steady. I haven't seen her, and can't take you
to her, but there's a sign-post that may show the way. There's no certainty in
it; it's just a chance. What do you say if I lead up to it? It's late in the
night, but I've no inclination to close my eyes, knowing I shouldn't sleep a
wink, I'm that stirred up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Neither could I sleep, Corrie. Let us sit and talk and smoke;
here's a spare pipe and tobacco--and you shall tell me in your own way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Corrie nodded, and filled his pipe, and lit it Basil did the
same, and waited in anxious expectancy, while Corrie puffed and contemplated the
ceiling meditatively.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In my own way, Master Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In your own way, Corrie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A roundabout way, but there's plenty of time before daybreak,
and then a couple of hours sleep will make us both fit. Old bushmen like
ourselves won't miss one night's rest.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_35" href="#div1Ref_35">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">There was distinct tenderness in Old Corrie's face as he
watched the curling wreaths of smoke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't lay claim to being a poet,&quot; he said; &quot;I leave that to
my betters; but they almost seem to me to belong to poetry, these rings of smoke
that come and go. They bring back old times, and I could fancy we were in the
bush, sitting by the camp fire before turning in for the night, spinning yarns,
and as happy as blackbirds in spring. There's no life like it, Master Basil, say
what they will of the pleasures of the city. Pleasures! Good Lord! To think of
the lives some lead here and then to speak of pleasures! I'm not going to
preach, however; the ship's been battered about, but it has reached port,&quot;--he
touched Basil's hand gratefully--&quot;and here sits the old bushman recalling old
times. I shan't dwell upon them because I know it would be trying your patience.
I'd like you to give me a little information about yourself before I go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ask whatever you wish, Corrie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I left you on the goldfields, mates with Newman Chaytor, of
whom, as you know, I did not have a good opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;However badly you thought of him, you were justified.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You found him out at last.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I found him out at last.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did it take you long?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Years.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sorry to hear it. Did you get a proper knowledge of him
suddenly or gradually?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Suddenly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And all the time he was practising on you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Master Basil,&quot; said Old Corrie, gravely, &quot;you were never fit
to battle with human nature; you never understood the worst half of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps not, Corrie, but I understand it now. Newman Chaytor
is a black-hearted villain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am not surprised to hear you say so; I had my suspicions of
him from the first. Unreasonable, I grant you, no grounds to go upon; but there
they were, and I am sorry, for your sake, that they proved true. Where's my
gentleman now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In Europe, somewhere. I am hunting for him; it will be a dark
day for the traitor when I come face to face with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie looked at Basil keenly from under his eyebrows. &quot;Do
you want my assistance here?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do. You must be with me, by my side, when he and I are
together. With your aid, I succeed; without it, I fail. Do you require an
incentive? I will give you two.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I require none; it is sufficient that you want me and that
you believe I can be of assistance to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still, I will give you the two incentives. One is, that it is
not alone Newman Chaytor I am fighting: linked with him, if I have not been
misinformed, is an associate worthy of him--Gilbert Bidaud.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Little lady's uncle. A precious pair, he and Chaytor. If I
needed spurring, this would do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The other is, that I am not only fighting to defeat these
scoundrels, but to save your little lady Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Enough, enough,&quot; said Old Corrie; &quot;I'll bide my time to
learn. Meanwhile, I pledge myself to you. Why, Master Basil, to give those two
men their deserts, and to serve you and little lady, I'd go through fire and
water. I will unfold my budget first, and will make it as short as I can. When I
left you on the goldfields, I did what many another foolish fellow has done,
went to Sydney and spent a week or two there on the spree. What kind of pleasure
is to be got out of that operation heaven only knows, but it is supposed to be
the correct thing for a brainless, lucky gold-digger to do, and it leaves him
probably with empty pockets, and certainly with a headache and heartache that
ought to teach him to be wiser in future. There was no excuse for me: I wasn't a
young man, and wasn't fond of drink, and when at the end of a fortnight I came
to my sober senses, I said, 'Corrie, you're an old fool,' and I never said a
truer thing. That fortnight cost me a hundred pounds, I reckon. I treated every
man whose face I recognised, and a good many that were strange to me, and I
think it was the face of a gentleman I met in Pitt Street, who looked at me in a
kind of wonder, that pulled me up short. Somehow or other he reminded me of you,
Master Basil, though he wasn't a bit like you; but he was a gentleman, and you
are a gentleman, and the thought ran into my head like a flash of fire, 'What
would Master Basil think of me it he saw me now?' It staggered me, and I felt as
if I was behaving like a traitor to you to so forget myself. You had given me
your friendship, and I was showing that I was unworthy of it. I made my way back
to the hotel I was staying at, and plunged my head into a bucket of water, and
kept it there until I had washed away the fumes of half the cursed liquor I had
poured down my throat. Then I went to my bedroom, locked the door, threw myself
on the bed, and slept myself sober. 'Never again, Corrie, old boy,' I said,
'never again.' And I never did again, although I did some foolish things
afterwards that were quite as unwise though less disgraceful. I took ship home
and landed at St. Katherine's Docks with four thousand pounds in my pocket. Yes,
Master Basil, I had made that much and more on the goldfields, and it ought to
have lasted me my life. You shall hear how long it <i>did</i> last me. As a
matter of course I was regularly knocked over when I walked through the London
streets. The crowds of people, the gay shops, the cabs and 'busses, and
carriages, the hurly-burly, the great buildings, almost took my breath away. I
looked back at my old life in the woods, swinging my axe, felling trees, and
splitting slabs, with my laughing jackass on a branch near me, and the hum of
nature all around me, and I hardly knew whether I was awake or dreaming. Was I
happy in the London streets? I can't say; I was certainly bewildered, and that,
mayhap, prevented me from thinking of things in a sensible way. I was looking in
a shop window, speculating whether I oughtn't to buy some of the bright ties for
sale there, when a voice at my elbow says 'Good day, mate.' 'Good day, mate,'
said I, though the man was a stranger to me, at least I thought so at the
moment, but he soon unsettled my thought. 'Where have I met you, mate?' said he.
'In what part of the world?' 'On the goldfields, perhaps,' said I, like an
innocent pigeon. 'Most likely,' he said, on the goldfields. 'Your face strikes
me as familiar, but I don't remember your name.' 'My name is Corrie,' said I;
'Old Corrie I used to be called.' 'No,' he said, shaking his head; 'I don't
remember it. I've seen you on the goldfields, that's all, and it's only because
I never forget a face that I took the liberty of speaking to you. I ask your
pardon.' 'No offence, mate,' I said, and I shook the hand he held out before he
left me. Now, Master Basil, if that man had said, when I told him my name, that
we were old acquaintances, I should have been suspicious of him, but his honest
admission (it seemed honest) that he only recognised my face because he'd seen
it once or twice on the goldfields--which would have been the most natural thing
in the world--made me look upon him with favour, and as he walked away, I gazed
after him with a feeling of regret that he should leave me so quickly. He may
have gone a dozen yards when he looked back over his shoulder, and seeing me
staring after him, turned with a smile, and joined me again. 'It looks churlish
scudding off so unceremoniously,' said he, 'when I might by chance be of service
to you. When did you arrive?' 'I landed this morning,' I said, and I mentioned
the name of the ship. 'Have you friends in London?' he asked. 'No,' said I, 'I
am a stranger here.' 'Then you haven't taken lodgings yet,' said he. 'No,' I
answered, 'and to tell you the truth I am puzzled where to go.' He offered to
advise me, and I gladly availed myself of the offer. 'Come and have a chop with
me first,' said he, and we went to an eating-house all gilt and glass--I found
out afterwards that the street we were in was Cheapside--and had a chop and some
beer. He threw half-a-sovereign to the waiter, but I objected to it saying I
would pay. He insisted, saying he had invited me; but I insisted too, saying I
had plenty of money, and would take it as a favour if he would let me have my
way. The friendly wrangle ended in each of us paying his own score, and then as
though we had known each other all our lives, we went out together to a quiet
hotel, in a narrow street in the Strand, down by the river, where I engaged a
bedroom. I'll cut a long story short, Master Basil, so far as my new friend
goes, by telling you how it ended with me and him. He was so clever, and I was
so simple, that he wormed himself completely into my confidence, and I thought
myself lucky in having made such a friend. He told me all about himself, and I
told him all about myself; it was a regular case of Siamese twins: we were never
apart. One day he spoke of speculation, and of doubling one's money in a week,
and doubling it again when the opportunity offered, which wasn't too often. 'Of
your four thousand pounds, you make eight,' said he, 'of your eight thousand you
make sixteen, and if you like to stop, why there you are, you know.' Yes, there
I was, and no mistake. The opportunity that presented itself to my confidential
friend was something in my way--a quartz reef on the Avoca, to be formed into a
company. He showed me figures which I couldn't dispute, and didn't wish to
dispute. The truth is, Master Basil, he had dazzled me. Sixteen thousand pounds
was certainly better than four, and to be content with one when you had only to
put your name on a piece of paper to secure the other was the act of a
simpleton. The upshot of it was that I went into the company and signed away the
whole of my money with the exception of a hundred pounds, and very soon found
out that I had signed it away for ever and a day. Good-bye, my three thousand
nine hundred pounds, and good-bye to my dear friend who had tickled me into his
web and made mincemeat of me. I never saw anything of either money or friend
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Old Corrie paused to load his pipe, which gave Basil time to
remark:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You said just now that I knew nothing of the worst side of
human nature. How about yourself, Corrie?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was my one mistake, Master Basil,&quot; replied Corrie
composedly. &quot;There's no excuse for me; I was an old fool. Let me have four
thousand pounds again, and see if I'm bit a second time. Now, being stranded
with about enough to keep a fellow but little more than a year, what was I to
do? If I had been the wise man I'm trying to make myself out to be, I should
have taken passage to Australia, and taken up my old life there. But more than
one thing held me back, and kept me here. First, there was a foolish pride; to
retreat was to confess myself beaten. Second, there was the chance of meeting
with the friend who had diddled me; it was about as strong as one thread of a
spider's web, but I dangled it before me. Third, I had never known what it was
to be without a crust of bread, and therefore had no fears on that score.
Another thing, perhaps, which only just now occurs to me, kept me in this
country. When I was a youngster there was a fatalist among my acquaintances. He
was the only thoroughly happy man I have ever known. Nothing worried or
disturbed him; he was a poor man, and he never grumbled at being poor; he met
with misfortunes, and he accepted them smilingly, and never struggled against
them; if he had broken his leg, and it had to be amputated, he wouldn't have
winced during the operation. He had what he called a philosophical theory, and
he explained it to me. 'Nothing that anyone can do,' he said, 'will prevent
anything occurring. Everything that is going to happen is set down beforehand,
and an army ten million strong couldn't stop a straw from blowing a certain way
if fate ordained that it was to blow that way. You can't prevent yourself from
being imposed upon, from being poor, from being rich, from being sick, from
being healthy, from living till you're a hundred, from dying when you're twenty,
from having a wife and blooming family, from living alone in a garret.
Therefore,' said he, 'it's of no use bothering about things. Do as I do--take
'em easy.' 'But how,' I said once to him, 'if I've got a different temper from
yours, and worry myself to death about trifles?' 'Then you are much to be
pitied,' said he, 'and I shall not trouble myself about you.' I pressed, him,
though, a little. 'If a man is good?' I asked. 'He is fated to be good,' he
answered. 'If he is a murderer?' I asked. 'He is fated to be a murderer,' he
answered. 'If he is born to be hanged, hanged he will be, as sure as there's a
sun above us.' Well, now, Master Basil, perhaps it was fated that I should
remain in England in order to meet with a certain adventure which I will tell
you of presently, and afterwards to meet you here in London to-night to assist
you to a fated end.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a hateful theory,&quot; said Basil. &quot;Were it true, vice
would be as meritorious as virtue, and monsters of iniquity would rank side by
side with angels of goodness. Go on with your story, Corrie, and put fatalism
aside.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So be it. Anyway, there I was, as my friend said, with a
hundred pounds in my pocket instead of sixteen thousand. I wasn't quite devoid
of prudence; I knew that a hundred pounds wouldn't last very long, and that it
would be as well if I could hit upon some plan to earn a livelihood. It was the
hop-picking season. 'I'll do a little hopping,' said I, and off I set towards
the heart of Kent for an autumn tour, seasoned with so many or so few shillings
a day. On the second night of my tramp I missed my way. I was in a woody
country, with the usual puzzling tracks and fences. The night was fine, but very
dark. Camping out in England is a very different thing from camping out in
Australia, and I didn't intend to camp out here if I could help it. But I was
tired, and I squatted myself on the grass which grew on a hill side, and thought
I'll rest an hour and then stumble onwards on the chance of reaching a village
where I could get a night's lodging. I was very comfortable; my legs hung down,
there was a rest for my back, and without any intention of doing so, I fell
asleep. I was awakened by something alive and warm quite close to me; I could
not see what it was, because when I opened my eyes I found that the night, from
being dark, had got black. There was not a star visible--everything was black,
above, below, around. But what was the object close to me? I put out my hand and
felt flesh covered with hair. 'A dog,' thought I; but passing my hand along the
body, I dismissed the dog idea in consequence of the size of the animal. It was
not high enough nor smooth enough for a horse. A donkey, perhaps; but if a
donkey, why was it muzzled? The creature uttered no sound while my hand was upon
it, but when I took my hand away to get a match--the only means at my command to
obtain a view of my strange companion--it put its head upon my arm, and then a
foot, just as though it wanted to pull me along in some particular
direction--and then I heard a growl. It made me start, though it was not a
threatening growl, and I wondered what sort of animal this could be that had
attached itself to me at such a time and in such a place. The next sound I heard
was the clank of a chain. I should have taken to my heels if I had not been
deterred by the thought that it might be safer to keep still, so I softly took
out my matchbox and struck a light--and there, with only a few inches between
our faces, was a great brown bear. I was startled, but I soon got over my fears.
I struck half a dozen matches, one after the other, to get a good look at my new
mate, and with the lighting of each fresh match I became more assured. I took
its paw in my hand, and found that its claws had been pared down; it opened its
mouth, and there was scarcely a tooth in it; I happened to hold up my arm, with
the lighted match in my hand, and the bear immediately stood on its hind legs
and pawed the air. I jumped immediately at the right conclusion. The creature
was a harmless performing bear, and it had either escaped from its master, or
the man was not far off, and it wished to lead me to him. I made an experiment.
I rose, picked up the end of the chain and cried, 'March!' March the bear did,
and I after it, for about a mile, and then it lay down by something on the road,
and moaned. I declare, Master Basil, there was a human sound in that moan, and I
knelt by its side and took a man's head on my knee. He was a foreigner, but
could speak fairly good English, and he told me that he had met with an
accident, having slipped on his ankle, and could not walk. 'Bruno went for
assistance,' said Bruno's master. 'Good Bruno! Good Bruno!' The kind voice of
the man attracted me: the affection between bear and master attracted me; and I
asked what I could do, saying the country was strange to me, and I did not know
my way. 'But I know,' said the man; 'there is a village two miles off. Help me
to get on Bruno's back, and we will go there, if you will be so good as to keep
with me.' I said I would keep with him, partly because I wanted a bed to sleep
in myself, and partly because I should be glad to be of service to him. With
some difficulty I got him on Bruno's back--the man was in pain, but he bore it
well--and the three of us trudged through the dark roads to the village, the man
with his head on my shoulder to keep his balance. It wasn't easy to get a
lodging; every house was shut, and then there was the bear, that nobody cared to
take in, not believing it was a harmless creature. However, we managed it at
last; Bruno was fastened up in an empty stable, and I helped its master to a
room where there were a couple of straw beds. His ankle was badly sprained, and
the next morning it was very little better. He managed to limp out, and the pair
of us, leading the bear, trudged to a common where a village fair was being
held, and there Bruno's master began to put the bear through its performances.
Pain compelled him to stop, and he asked me to take his place, instructing me
what words and gestures to use to make the patient creature do this or that. I
got along so well that I was quite proud of myself, and the comicality of my
suddenly becoming a showman never struck me till the evening, when the day's
work was done. You've come to something, Corrie,' said I, and I shook with
laughter. After tea the man counted up the takings, which amounted to close on
ten shillings, and divided them into three parts. 'One for Bruno,' said he, 'one
for me, one for you.' He pointed to my share, and I took it and pocketed it as
though I had been in the business all my life. Again, Master Basil, I'm going to
cut a long story short. I could talk all night about my adventures with Bruno
and its master, but I must come to the pith of my story. Take it, then, that the
three of us travelled about for nearly twelve months, just managing to pick up a
living, that my foreign mate fell sick and had to go into a hospital, that he
died there, and that at his death I found myself with Bruno on my hands,
established as a regular showman. I accepted the position; I could do nothing
else; I couldn't run away from the bear because I felt I should in some way be
held answerable to the law for desertion; we belonged to each other, and it
wasn't at my option to dissolve the partnership. My little stock of money was
diminished by this time in consequence of my mate's illness and the expenses of
his funeral, and I knew that Bruno's antics would always earn me a few shillings
a week. So there we were, Bruno and I, going about the country with never a word
or growl of disagreement between us till we came to a fashionable sea-side place
called Bournemouth. I had gone through the performances, and Bruno and I were
walking from street to street looking for another pitch when I was struck almost
dumb with amazement at a sound that reached my ears. It was the voice of a bird
speaking some words in a loud key, and the words were--what do you think, Master
Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can't imagine, Corrie,&quot; replied Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The words were, 'Little lady, little lady! Basil and Annette!
Basil, Basil, Basil--dear Basil!'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Corrie,&quot; cried Basil, in a voice of wonder and joy, &quot;you are
not deceiving me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, Master Basil, I am telling you the plain truth. You may
imagine by your own feelings the effect those words had upon me. What bird but
the magpie I had trained and taught for little lady could have uttered them? And
after all these years too! I could scarcely believe my ears, but there was the
bird, piping away at the window--I turned and saw it in a cage--calling to me,
in a manner of speaking, to come and say how do you do? I went straight up to
the house and knocked at the door. The woman who opened it started back at sight
of the bear. 'It won't hurt you, ma'am,' I said, 'there's not a bit of vice in
it. I've come to ask you something about a bird you've got. It's an old friend
of mine, and I trained it for a young lady in Australia, and taught it some of
the things it says.' 'Sure enough,' said the woman, keeping as far away from
Bruno as she could, the bird's an Australian bird, and the young lady it belongs
to was born in Australia. Emily's not at home now----' 'Not Emily, ma'am,
begging your pardon,' I said, interrupting her; 'Miss Annette's the young lady I
mean. Her father's name was Bidaud, and Basil, one of the names I taught the
magpie to speak, was a dear friend of hers and mine.' 'Oh, yes,' said the woman,
'I know all about that. My daughter Emily is Miss Bidaud's maid, and she is
taking care of the bird for her mistress for a little while. Emily's home for a
holiday, but she's gone to see some friends in London, and won't be back till
the day after to-morrow. Can I do anything of you?' 'You can tell me, if you
please,' said I, 'where Miss Annette is. I'm sure she'll be glad to see me,' My
idea was, Master Basil, to see little lady and ask her if she had any news of
you, though I wanted, too, to see her for her own sake. Well, all at once the
woman grew suspicious of me, and instead of speaking civil she spoke snappish.
'No,' she said, 'I shan't tell you anything about Miss Bidaud. You're a showman,
travelling about with a big, nasty bear, and likely as not you're up to no
good.' I didn't fire up; the woman had fair reason on her side. 'I'm a
respectable man, ma'am,' I said, 'and it's only by accident I came into company
with Bruno. My name's Corrie, and Miss Annette would thank you for telling me
where she is.' But she wouldn't, Master Basil; all that I could get out of her
was that I might come and see Emily the day after to-morrow, and her daughter
could then do as she liked about telling me what I wanted to know. I went away
with the determination to come back and have a talk with little lady's maid, but
things don't always turn out as we want them to do. Very seldom indeed. That
night there was a great hubbub in the place I was stopping at. Bruno had broke
loose and gone goodness knows where, and all sorts of stupid stories got about
that the bear was mad and was biting everybody it met. I had to go in search of
the creature, and the police kept me in sight. A pretty dance Bruno led me. I
was hunting for it three days and nights, and when I found it at last it was in
a sorry plight. I shall never forget that evening, Master Basil. I don't know
the rights of the story, but I was certain that Bruno had been set upon by dogs
and men--it had marks of fresh wounds upon its body--and been hunted from place
to place. When I caught sight of the bear it was lying by the side of a little
pool, and at a little distance were some twenty men and boys pelting it with
stones. I scattered them right and left, and knelt by Bruno's side. The poor
beast tried to raise its head, but couldn't, and I got some water from the pool,
which was all mudded with the stone-throwing, and bathed its mouth. It thanked
me with its eyes--it did, Master Basil--and did its best to lick my hand. Its
chest went up and down like billows of the sea, and once it gave a great sob as
if its heart was broke. After that it got quieter, but it could neither eat nor
drink. A policeman came up and told me to move on. 'Come, Bruno,' I said,
'march, my man. The law's got its eyes on you.' The creature actually managed to
stand, and, more than that, got up on its hind legs as it did when it was
performing. It pawed the air a little, and looked at me for orders, and then
fell down all of a heap. 'Come,' said the policeman, 'you must move on, the pair
of you.' 'Not possible, the pair of us,' said I, sorrowfully. 'Try if your
truncheon can bring it to life.' Bruno dead was much more difficult to manage
than Bruno alive. I had to pay money to get rid of its body, and then somebody
summoned me for a scratch or a bite Bruno had given him, he said, and I had to
pay money for that. All this took me some time, and I had very little money left
at the end of it. I hadn't the heart to go back to Bournemouth to get little
lady's address. What should I do with it when I got it? Go to her and beg? No, I
was too proud for that. Most likely she was with her uncle, Mr. Gilbert Bidaud,
the gentleman who wouldn't respect a dead brother's word, and I knew what I
might expect from him. So I gave up the idea and came to London--came here to
starve, Master Basil, for I could get no work to do, and have gone through more
than I care to tell of. If I hadn't met you to-night I should have wandered
about the streets, as I've done for many and many a night already; but I'll not
dwell upon it. I've told my story as straight as I could.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_36" href="#div1Ref_36">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a strange story,&quot; said Basil, &quot;but less strange than
the story I have to relate. We have both experienced the pangs of hunger and
solitude, with wealth and luxury all around us. What chiefly interests me is
your adventure in Bournemouth. Emily, you said, is the name of Annette's maid?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So her mother said.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And the mother's name?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I ascertained that--Crawford.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know the name of the street in which she lives?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lomax Road. I put it down on paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If we were in Bournemouth, you could take me to the house?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Straight.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We will go there to-morrow; there will be little sleep for us
to-night, Corrie. As regards Annette do you draw any conclusions about her
character--for the Child and the woman are frequently at odds with one
another--from the incident of the bird?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do; Master Basil. I draw the sign of constancy. None but a
constant nature would have kept the bird so long, would have valued it so long,
would have taught it new words.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;New words!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Master Basil. If it said 'dear Basil' once, it said it
twenty times while the woman and I were talking. When I gave the bird to little
lady it couldn't say 'dear,' so she must have taught the lesson with her own
pretty lips. A straw will tell which way the wind blows.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you, Corrie. When you have heard me out you will
understand what all this means to me.&quot; The recital of his adventures occupied
him over an hour, and Corrie listened with bent brows and without a single word
of interruption. His pipe went out, and he made no attempt to relight it; the
only movement he made was to turn his head occasionally, as though something
Basil had just said had inspired a new thought. Basil brought his narrative down
to this very night, and paused only when he came to where Old Corrie accosted
him at the street door. &quot;What do you think of it, Corrie?&quot; he asked, when he had
finished. &quot;It is wonderful,&quot; said Corrie. &quot;My story is but a molehill by the
side of your mountain. There's no time to lose, Master Basil; a day, an hour,
may be precious, if little lady is to be saved.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No time shall be lost,&quot; said Basil; &quot;an hour's rest in our
clothes after we've done talking, and at daybreak we are off to see how soon and
how quickly we can get to Bournemouth. There is a question I haven't asked you.
How long is it since you were in Bournemouth?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It must be six months, quite; but I kept no account of time.
What a fool I was not to go back and see Emily Crawford!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We'll waste no time in lamenting. What is past is past, and
no man can foresee what is in the future. Do you see, now, how important your
evidence is likely to be to me? Without it I might be compelled to pass through
life bearing the shameful name of the villain who betrayed me. Corrie, there are
anxious and dreaded possibilities in the future to which I dare not give
utterance. I can only hope and work. Now let us rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He wanted Corrie to take his bed, but Corrie refused, and,
throwing himself on the floor, was soon asleep. Not so Basil; the events of the
night had been too exciting for forgetfulness, and though he dozed off now and
then, his brain did not rest a moment. He was none the worse for it in the
morning; despite the trials he had undergone his naturally strong constitution
asserted itself and enabled him to bear more than an ordinary amount of fatigue.
The moment he arose from his bed Old Corrie jumped to his feet as brisk as a
lark.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm a new man, Master Basil,&quot; he said; &quot;the prospect of
something to do is as good as wine to me. There's no curse like the curse of
idleness.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They washed and breakfasted, and then went out. It was early
morning, and there were not many people astir.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We are going first,&quot; said Basil, &quot;to see Mr. Philpott, of
whom I told you last night. I have an impression that Mr. Gilbert Bidaud is not
in England. If we are fortunate enough in striking the trail, and he is in a
foreign country, the task we are set upon may be long and difficult. I am
debating whether it would be advisable to ask Philpott to accompany us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;From your opinion of him,&quot; said Corrie, &quot;he is a man to be
trusted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thoroughly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In a foreign country I should be next door to useless, except
to prove that you are yourself. Mr. Philpott is accustomed to such jobs as this,
and knows the tricks of hunting men down. I should say take him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, if he is agreeable. He doesn't know who I really am,
though he has perhaps a suspicion of the truth, and it will be necessary that I
should tell him my story. If he can come with us I shall have no hesitation in
confiding in him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They found the Philpott family at breakfast.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought we were early birds, sir,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, while
his wife dusted two chairs for the visitors, &quot;but there are other birds, I see,
more wide-awake than we are. Why, it's barely seven o'clock! Breakfast done when
the clock strikes--that's my notion of bringing up a family.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've something of importance to say to you,&quot; said Basil,
&quot;when you've finished.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Finished now, sir,&quot; said Philpott; &quot;always ready for
business. We'll talk outside if you don't mind. Mother hasn't had time to do the
rooms yet.&quot; They walked up and down the quiet street, and after Basil had
ascertained that Philpott was able and willing to accompany him, and that the
next train for Bournemouth did not start for a couple of hours, he communicated
to Philpott all he considered it necessary that worthy man should know of his
history.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A singular story, sir,&quot; said Philpott, &quot;about as good as
anything that's come my way up to now. I always told mother there was something
out of the common about you. That Mr. Chaytor must be an out-and-outer--as
cunning as they make 'em now-a-days. It's as well you should have a man like me
with you. I know the ropes; you don't. Let's get to the office, sir. I must give
'em notice I'm going away on an important job. Luckily there's nothing very
particular on hand just now.&quot; This preliminary was soon accomplished, and Basil
and his companions arrived at Waterloo Station a few minutes before the train
started for Bournemouth. On the road it was arranged that Basil should go alone
to Mrs. Crawford's house.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The woman might be frightened,&quot; said Philpott, &quot;at three men
coming to make inquiries. To a gentleman like you she will be open and frank.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Leaving Old Corrie and Philpott on the beach, Basil walked to
Lomax Road, the number of the house in which Mrs. Crawford lived being 14, as he
was informed by an obliging resident. He lingered outside, and looked up at the
windows for signs of the magpie, but no sound reached his ears, and with
somewhat of a despondent feeling he knocked at the door. So much depended upon
the next few minutes! If he should have to leave Mrs. Crawford unsatisfied,
without a clue to guide him, he would be no further advanced than on the day he
first set foot in London. All he wanted was a starting point, and he vowed to
leave no stone unturned to obtain it, and that once he gained it, he would
follow it up till it led him to the end. The door was opened, and a
decent-looking woman stood before him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mrs. Crawford?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wish to speak to you upon a subject very dear to me; I can
offer no other excuse for intruding upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was an unconscious wistfulness in his voice, which
interested Mrs. Crawford. There is no surer way of winning a woman's sympathies
than by appealing to them in some such way as this, and making them understand
it is in their power to assist you.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you a Bournemouth gentleman, sir?&quot; asked Mrs. Crawford.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I have never been in Bournemouth before to-day. I have
travelled a long distance to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you walk in, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He followed her to the sitting-room. A little girl some seven
or eight years old was sitting there, turning over the pages of a child's
picture-book.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Run and play, Genie,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your little girl?&quot; asked Basil, drawing the child to his
knee.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Basil took half-a-crown from his pocket. &quot;Ask
mamma, by-and-by, to buy you a toy with this.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you say, Genie?&quot; cried the gratified mother.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said the child, holding her bashful head
down.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil gave her a kiss, and she ran to her mother with the
half-crown, and afterwards left the room, shyly glancing at Basil, whose kind
manners, no less than the half-crown, had won her heart. And the mother's also,
it is almost needless to say.</p>

<p class="normal">Basil looked around the walls. No sign of a bird. Then he
turned to the mantel-shelf and saw there the portrait of a young woman, bearing
in her face a strong resemblance to Mrs. Crawford.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Another daughter of yours,&quot; he observed. &quot;I can see the
likeness.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir, and a good girl, and a good daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am sure she is. Might I inquire her name?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Emily, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is she at home?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir; she is abroad with her mistress.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil's heart beat high with hope already there was something
gained.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Am I mistaken in my belief,&quot; he asked, &quot;that her mistress is
Miss Annette Bidaud?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is the young lady's name, sir. I hope you will excuse my
asking why you keep on looking round the room, and why you looked up at the
windows of the house in the same way before you knocked at the street-door? I
saw you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was looking for an old friend I had an idea was here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An old friend, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, a magpie that Miss Bidaud brought with her from
Australia.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Crawford's face flushed up, and she said in a tone of
vexation:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was here a little while, sir, and it got me into trouble.
But it was nobody's fault but my own. Excuse me again, sir--you speak as if you
knew Miss Bidaud.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I knew her intimately; she and I were, and I hope are, very
dear friends. Her father and I had a great esteem for each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That was in Australia, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That was in Australia. Miss Bidaud was but a child at the
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have seen her since, I suppose, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not. To be frank with you, that is the object of my
visit to you. I earnestly desire to know where she is.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is a beautiful young lady now, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Crawford;
diverging a little; from the expression on her face she seemed to be considering
something as she gazed attentively at Basil. &quot;Perhaps you can recognise her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She handed Basil an album, and he turned over its pages till
he came to a portrait which rivetted his attention. It was the portrait of
Annette; he recognised it instantly, but how beautiful she had grown! An artist
had coloured the picture, and the attractive subject must have interested him
deeply, so well and skilfully was the colouring done. The gracefully-shaped
head, the long, golden-brown hair, the lovely hazel eyes, magnetised Basil, as
it were. There was a pensive look in the eyes, and something of wistfulness in
the expression of the mouth, which Basil construed into a kind of appeal. It may
be forgiven him if he thought that it was to him the mute face was appealing.
Long and earnestly did he gaze: reminiscences of the happy hours they had passed
together floated through his mind; her confidence, her trust in him, and her
father's last words on the evening on which he had accepted the guardianship of
his child, were never less powerful and, sacred in the sense they conveyed of a
duty yet to be performed than they were at this moment. When, at length, he
raised his eyes from the portrait, Mrs. Crawford saw tears in them. Had she had
any doubts of her visitor, these tears would have dispelled them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is she not lovely, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has the face of an angel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is what my Emily says, sir; she dotes on my young lady,
sir, and would work her fingers to the bone to serve her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Miss Miss Bidaud, then, has one faithful friend by her side.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You may say that, sir. There have been mistresses and
servants but there never was mistress and servant so bound to each other as my
Emily and my young lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are in Europe?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes, sir, they are in Europe. I'll tell you presently
where, but I must finish what I was saying at first. It was about the
magpie--the bird you were looking for--as sensible a feathered thing as ever
piped a note. Emily wanted badly to come and see me, and some other of her
relations in England, and it happened that her uncle and guardian Mr. Gilbert
Bidaud--you know the gentleman, sir?&quot; asked Mrs. Crawford, breaking off
suddenly; she had noticed a dark flash in Basil's eyes at the mention of the
name.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I had a brief acquaintance with him in Australia,&quot; replied
Basil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you like him, sir? Is he a friend of yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Before he replied he looked attentively at her, and a tacit
understanding seemed to pass between them. Without further hesitation he
answered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not like him. He is no friend of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Crawford nodded her head in a satisfied manner, and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The more likely you are to be a friend of Miss Bidaud's.
Well, sir, it happened that Mr. Gilbert Bidaud was going to pay a flying visit
to several foreign places, and, of course, was going to take my young lady with
him. He never lets her out of his sight if he can help it, but Emily is very
nearly a match for him. I don't say quite, but very nearly, Emily <i>is</i>
clever. Mr. Bidaud made a great fuss about taking the bird and the cage with
them on this journey, and wanted my young lady to leave it behind, but she
wouldn't, and proposed instead that Emily should have her holiday while they
were away and should take care of the bird and take it back when her holiday was
over. That is how the bird came to be here. Eight months ago it was, and Emily
was away on a visit, when a man with a great ugly bear came to the house and
began to ask questions about the bird. He said just what you said, that it was
an old friend of his, and that he'd trained it for my young lady in Australia.
He knew my young lady's name, and he wanted me to tell him where she was to be
found. Well, sir, I don't know how it was, but I got suspicious of him. What
business could a common-looking man like him have with a young lady like Miss
Bidaud? As like as not he wanted to impose upon her, and it wasn't for me to
help him to do that. It didn't look well, did it, sir, that a man going about
the country with a bear should be trapesing after my young lady? So I was very
short with him, and I refused to tell him anything, but said if he liked to come
in a day or two Emily would be home, and then he could speak to her about my
young lady. He went away, after leaving his name--Corrie, it was--and I never
set eyes on him again. That seemed to prove I'd done right, but I hadn't, for
Emily said, when she came home, that my young lady thought a good deal of this
Mr. Corrie, and had often spoken of him, and that he did train and give her the
bird, just as he said he had. Emily said my young lady would be very sorry when
she heard I'd turned Mr. Corrie away, and that she would give a good deal if she
could see the poor man. Every letter I get from my daughter she asks me if I've
seen anything more of Mr. Corrie, and to be sure if I do to tell him where my
young lady is stopping. I could beat myself with vexation when I think of it.
Perhaps you could tell me something of him, as you were all in Australia at the
same time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can. He is here with me in Bournemouth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here in Bournemouth, sir! Oh, what a relief you have given
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He told you a true story, Mrs. Crawford, every word of it,
and is a sterling, honest fellow. You see how wrong it is to judge people by
their appearance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps it is, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Crawford, a little doubtfully,
and added, with excusable flattery, &quot;I judged you by yours, sir. I hope you will
bring Mr. Corrie here, but not his bear, sir, and I'll beg his pardon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No need to do that; Corrie is the last man to blame you for
doing what you believed to be right. As for the poor bear, it is dead. I will go
and fetch Corrie presently, and you can make it up with him; but tell me now
where Miss Bidaud is to be found.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is in Switzerland, with her uncle and aunt, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I want the exact address, Mrs. Crawford, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here it is, sir, on a piece of paper. It is my Emily's
writing, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil wrote down the address: &quot;Villa Bidaud, Fernex, near
Geneva, Switzerland.&quot; His hand trembled as he wrote. At last he was fairly on
the track of the traitor. His heart beat tumultuously, and for a moment he was
overcome with dizziness; but he immediately recovered himself, and continued the
conversation. &quot;Do you write to your daughter to this address?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Villa Bidaud. That sounds as if it were a long-established
residence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They live there on and off, sir, for a few weeks or a few
months at a time. I think when they go travelling the house is shut up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your daughter has doubtless given you a description of the
house. Is it small or large?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Large, I should say, and very old. There must be a good many
rooms in it, and it stands in the middle of a very large garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mrs. Crawford, look at me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Somewhat surprised at the request, Mrs. Crawford looked at
Basil, and saw a face quivering with earnestness, and eyes in which truth and
honour shone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she said, and waited. &quot;I want you to be certain
that I am a man who is to be trusted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am certain of it, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That I am a man who would do no woman wrong, and that in my
present visit to you I am animated by an honest, earnest desire to serve the
young lady your daughter serves and loves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am certain of it, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Being certain of it,&quot; said Basil, &quot;is there nothing more you
can tell me that might aid me in my desire to be of service to Miss Bidaud? I
gather from what you have said that your daughter is sincerely attached to her
young mistress, and she will know whether Miss Bidaud is happy or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm not sure, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Crawford, speaking slowly,
&quot;whether I've a right to tell everything, you being a stranger to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But not a stranger to Miss Bidaud,&quot; said Basil, eagerly,
&quot;remember that, Mrs. Crawford. Next to her father, I was in Australia her
dearest friend----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you sure of that, sir?&quot; interrupted Mrs. Crawford. &quot;We
sometimes deceive ourselves. My young lady, to my knowledge had a friend in
Australia--a young gentleman like yourself--she thought all the world of. Emily
says she was never tired of speaking about him and of his kindness to her. His
name is Mr. Basil Whittingham. Perhaps you are acquainted with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know something of him,&quot; said Basil. He had been on the
point of disclosing himself, but remembrance of the part Newman Chaytor was
playing checked him in time.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course, there may be others,&quot; continued Mrs. Crawford,
&quot;and it isn't for me to dispute with you; but if there's one thing that is more
positive than another, it is that my young lady thought all the world of Mr.
Whittingham. You are Miss Bidaud's friend, and you don't seem to think much of
her uncle. That's the way with us. My Emily hates the very sight of him--though
she doesn't let him see it, you may be sure, sir--because of the way he behaves
to Miss Bidaud. How I come to know so much about Mr. Whittingham is, because all
the letters he wrote to Miss Bidaud from Australia were addressed to my care. If
they hadn't been, my young lady's uncle or aunt would have got hold of them and
she would never have seen them. When they arrived I used to put them in an
envelope and address them to my Emily--not to Villa Bidaud, but to different
post-offices, according to the directions she gave me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were there many of these letters?&quot; asked Basil, keeping guard
upon his feelings.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About one every six or seven months, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you aware whether they afforded pleasure to Miss Bidaud?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir, they gave her the greatest possible pleasure. She
was always happy after she got one, so my Emily wrote to me. That makes it all
the stranger.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Makes what all the stranger?&quot; Again Mrs. Crawford looked at
Basil with a possible doubt of the wisdom of her loquacity; but she was
naturally a gossip, and the sluice being open the waters continued to flow.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, sir, my young lady had set her heart upon Mr.
Whittingham coming home--that much my daughter knew from what she said; and,
although she said nothing about it to Emily, there was something else she set
her heart upon. There are some things, you know, sir, a delicate-minded young
lady doesn't tell her best friend till they're settled; and perhaps Miss Bidaud
herself didn't quite know what her feelings for Mr. Whittingham were. She was
very young when she left Australia, and her uncle hadn't been anxious to
introduce her to society, so since she's been home she has seen very little of
young men. But lookers on can see most of the game, sir, and my Emily said to
me, 'When Mr. Whittingham comes home there'll be a match made up, you see if
there won't, mother.' 'But how about the uncle?' I asked, for it was pretty
clear to me, from what I heard, that there was no love lost between Mr. Bidaud
and Mr. Whittingham. Then my Emily tells me that, for all my young lady's gentle
ways and manners, she sometimes showed a will of her own when anything very dear
to her was in question. That is how she has been able to keep the bird Mr.
Corrie gave her; if it hadn't been that she was determined, her uncle would have
made away with it long ago. I didn't quite agree with Emily. I argued like this,
sir. Supposing, when Mr. Whittingham came home, he and my young lady found they
loved each other, and made a match of it. So far, all well and good; but the
moment Mr. Bidaud discovered it, he would take steps. He is Miss Bidaud's
natural guardian, and my young lady is not yet of age. What would her uncle do?
Whip her away, and take her where Mr. Whittingham couldn't get at her. Perhaps
discharge Emily, and so deprive Miss Bidaud of every friend she has, and of
every opportunity of acting contrary to him. He's artful enough to carry that
out. I don't quite know the rights of it, but Emily says he has control of all
my young lady's fortune, and she don't believe he has any of his own. Well,
then, does it stand to reason that he would let the money he lives upon slip
through his fingers through any carelessness of his own, or that he would hand
it quietly over to a man he hates like poison? That's the way I urged, sir, but
it's all turned out different. Of course you know, sir, that Mr. Basil
Whittingham's come home.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have heard so,&quot; said Basil, quietly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And has come into a great fortune!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have heard that, also.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Miss Bidaud was overjoyed when she saw him, and her uncle was
the other way. But if Emily's last two letters mean anything they mean that
things have got topsy turvy like. Mr. Whittingham and Mr. Bidaud are great
friends now, and as for my young lady being happy, that's more than I can say.
There's no understanding young people now; it was different in my time; but
there, they say the course of true love never runs smooth. One thing seems
pretty plain--there's a screw loose somewhere in Villa Bidaud. And now, sir,
I've told you everything, and likely as, not I've been too free, and done what I
shouldn't. If I have done wrong I shall never hear the last of it from Emily.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will live to acknowledge,&quot; said Basil, &quot;that you have
done right, and that your confidence is not misplaced. I thank you from my
heart, and am grateful for the good fortune that led me to you. Mrs. Crawford, I
don't like to offer you money for the service you have rendered me, though I
hope I shall be in the humour to insist, before long, upon your allowing me to
make a fitting acknowledgment. But there is something I should wish to purchase
of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have nothing to sell, sir, that you would care to have.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would give more than its weight in gold,&quot; said Basil,
laying his hand upon the album, &quot;for the portrait of Miss Bidaud. You can have
no idea of the value it would be to me, and how much I should esteem your
kindness. Let me have it, I entreat you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't like to part with it,&quot; said Mrs. Crawford, looking
admiringly at Basil, &quot;but I can't refuse you. Take it, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil quickly availed himself of the permission, and put a
sovereign on the table, saying, &quot;For little Genie. Buy her a pretty frock with
it.&quot; Then wishing her good day, and thanking her again he left her to rejoin Old
Corrie and Mr. Philpott on the beach, and communicate the good news to them.
Half-an-hour later Old Corrie paid a visit to Mrs. Crawford, and received her
profuse excuses for the abrupt manner in which he had behaved to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nobody can blame you, ma'am,&quot; said Corrie, &quot;for fighting shy
of a bear. It's a wonder to me now how I came to be mates with the creature. But
he was a worthy comrade, ma'am, rough as his outside was--a deal worthier than
some men I've met with. And I shall never forget it, ma'am, because in the first
place it brought me straight to you, and in the second place it's taking me
straight to a little lady.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_37" href="#div1Ref_37">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">We must now return to Newman Chaytor. He had established his
position as Basil Whittingham, he had obtained possession of Basil's fortune, he
was on a familiar footing with the Bidauds. In his proceedings respecting the
fortune which Mr. Bartholomew Whittingham had bequeathed to his nephew, he
experienced, practically, no difficulty whatever. The evidence in his
possession, proving himself to be the man he represented himself to be, was
complete; and there being no grounds for suspicion, none was aroused. Thus he
was so far safe, and on the high road.</p>

<p class="normal">He went to London, and remained there only a few days. He made
no attempt to see his parents, and was careful to avoid the neighbourhood in
which they lived. With a large fortune at his disposal, and being fertile in
methods, he could easily have contrived to convey a few pounds to them without
drawing attention upon himself; but his character has been unsuccessfully
delineated if it is supposed he ever allowed himself to yield to the dictates of
humanity. He knew that his parents were in direst poverty--his mother's last
letter to him made this very clear--but he had not the slightest feeling of
compassion for the mother who idolised him or the father he had brought to ruin.
Self, in its most abhorrent aspect, ruled every action of his life. His own
ease, his own pleasures, his own safety--these were paramount, and pioneered him
through the crooked paths he had trod since boyhood. The correspondence he had
kept up with Annette rendered it an easy matter for him to find her. He had
apprised her that he was starting for home, and had directed her not to write to
him again to Australia. In this last letter he informed her that he had come
into a great fortune, and that his time would be so taken up by business matters
for a few weeks that he would not be able to see her immediately he arrived in
England. He gave her instructions how to communicate with him at home, and told
her to be sure to keep a corner in her heart for him. It is hard to say how many
times Annette read this letter. Basil was on his way home--coming home, coming
home, coming home--she kept on repeating the magic words; and there was a light
in her eyes, music in her voice, and joy in her heart. At last, at last he was
coming, the friend whom she could trust, the man her dear father had loved and
honoured. She would see him soon, for he would not linger over the business he
had to transact; her hand would be in his, his eyes on her face--and then she
blushed and ran to the glass. Had she changed since he last saw her? Would he
know her again, or would she have to say, &quot;Basil, I am Annette?&quot; No! that would
not be necessary; she had sent him her portrait, and he had told her in a letter
that he would pick her out of a thousand women. She had changed--yes, she was
aware of that, and aware, too, that she was very beautiful. What woman is not
who has grace and beauty for her dower; and is there a woman in the world who is
not proud of the possession, and who does not smile and greet herself in the
mirror as she gazes upon the bright reflection of a brighter reality? Annette
was innocently glad that she was fair, and all through her gladness the form of
Basil was before her. If he liked her for nothing else, he would like her for
her beauty. The quality of vanity there was in this thought was human and
natural. The name of Basil represented to her all that there was of nobility,
goodness, and generosity. In Basil was centred all that was best and brightest
in life. She worshipped an ideal. He had asked her to keep a corner in her heart
for him. Was not her whole heart his? And he was coming home--home! The word
assumed a new meaning. It would be truly home when Basil was with her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are excited, Annette,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, who, although
he seldom indulged in long conversations with his niece, noted every sign and
change in her. Only in one respect had he been baffled; he had not succeeded in
discovering how the correspondence between Basil and Annette was carried on. He
suspected Annette's maid, Emily, but that shrewd young person was so
extraordinarily careful and astute that he could not lure her, for all the traps
he set, into betraying herself. He hinted once to Annette that he thought of
discharging her, but Annette had shown so much spirit that he went no farther.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Emily is my maid,&quot; said Annette, &quot;and no one but I have a
right to discharge her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you do not mean to do so?&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, uncle, I do not mean to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even though I expressed a wish that she should go.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even then, uncle, I should not consent to her leaving me. I
am fond of her. If she goes, I go too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You go! where?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where you would not find me, uncle.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert thought there would be danger in that. She might fall
into other hands, and herself and fortune be lost to him. He was not quite sure
of his position in respect to Annette, and his best safety lay in not disturbing
the waters. His brother's affairs in Australia had been administered hastily,
and he was uneasily conscious that here in Europe clever lawyers might make
things awkward for him. He had Annette's fortune absolutely in his control; he
had used her money for his own purposes, for he had none of his own; he had kept
no accounts; in worldly matters Annette was a child, and was not likely to
become wiser so long as she was in his charge. She was obedient and docile in
most ways, the only exceptions being her feeling for Emily, and the secret
correspondence she was carrying on with Basil. These matters were not important;
they did not trench upon his authority or position. The letters she wrote were
such as a fanciful, sentimental girl would write, and Basil's letters were
probably harmless enough. Besides, he was at a safe distance. Time enough to
fight when the enemy was in view. &quot;He will marry,&quot; thought Gilbert Bidaud, &quot;he
will forget her. Let her indulge in her fancies. It is safest.&quot; So time went on,
outwardly calm, till Annette received Basil's letter announcing his intended
return to England. It was then that Gilbert noted the change in her. They were
on the continent at the time; of late years Gilbert seldom visited England;
there was more enjoyment and greater security for him in his own country and in
others more congenial to him. He purchased, with Annette's money, a villa in
Fernex, which he called Villa Bidaud. The deeds were made out in his own name;
he had come to regard Annette's fortune as his; if troublesome thoughts sprang
up he put them aside, trusting to his own cleverness to overcome any
difficulties that might present themselves.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are excited, Annette,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">She hardly knew what to say. To deny it was impossible; her
restless movements, her sparkling eyes, her joyous face, were sufficient
confirmation of her uncle's statements. But to admit it would lead to questions
which she wished to avoid answering. Therefore she was silent.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear niece,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, in his smooth voice,
&quot;there is not that confidence between us which I should wish to exist. Why? Have
I oppressed you? Have I treated you harshly? You can scarcely so accuse me. Have
I not allowed you to have your own way in all things? You have had perfect
liberty, have you not? Be frank with me. I have at heart only your interests. I
wish only to secure your happiness. When your poor father--my dear
brother--died, you were almost a baby, a child ignorant of the world and the
ways of the world. I said to my heart--it is my habit, my dear niece, to commune
with myself--I said to my heart, 'Annette is a child, an infant, with strong
affections and attachments. You come to her a stranger, yes, even while you are
closest to her in blood, you are still to her a stranger. She will not regard
you with favour; she will not understand you.' And so it was. It was my unhappy
duty to be stern and hard with some you regarded as friends; it was my duty to
be firm with you. Consequently, we commenced badly, and I, who am in my way
proud as you are, stood aloof from you and exercised the duties of guardian and
uncle without showing that my heart was filled with love for you. Thus have we
lived, with a spiritual gulf dividing us. My dear niece, you are no longer a
child, you are a woman who can think for herself, who is open to reason. Let us
bridge that gulf. I extend to you the hand of amity, of love. Take it, and tell
me how I can minister to your happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was the most gracious, as it was the falsest speech he had
ever made to her, and she was deceived by his specious frankness. She could not
refuse the hand he held out to her, and as she placed hers within it, she
reflected, &quot;When Basil arrives they must meet. They were not friends in
Australia, but it will be a good thing accomplished if they can be made friends
here, through me. Then Basil can come freely, with uncle's consent, and there
need be no concealment. Uncle never spoke to me like that before, and perhaps I
have been to blame as well as he. Neither he nor aunt has shown any great love
for me, but may it not have been partly my own fault. If they have wounded me,
may I not have wounded them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud saw that she was reflecting upon the new view
he had presented to her, and he did not disturb her meditations. Presently she
said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Uncle, I have had some good news.&quot; &quot;It delights me,&quot; said
Gilbert Bidaud. &quot;In your own good time you shall confide it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will confide it to you now. Basil is coming home.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;See now,&quot; said Gilbert, in a tone of great good-humour, &quot;how
you have misjudged me. Here have you, my ward, over whom I have the right to
exercise some authority, been corresponding with a young gentleman between whom
and myself there are differences of opinion. Candidly I admit that I did not
look upon him with love. Know now for the first time that on the plantation I
was warned against him, that he had enemies who spoke of him as an adventurer.
How was I to know that those who spoke thus spoke falsely? You may answer, being
a woman who has cherished in her heart a regard for her Australian friend, 'You
should have asked me; I would have told you the truth about him.' Ah, but
consider. What were you? A mere infant, innocent, guileless, unsuspecting. I
venerate childhood, and venerate it the more because it has no worldly wisdom.
Happy, happy state! Would that we could live all our lives in ignorance so
blissful! Then there would be no more duplicity, no more cheating and roguery.
But it is otherwise, and we must accept the world. Therefore the young gentleman
and I crossed swords on the first day we met, and from that time have
misunderstood each other. In my thoughts, perhaps, I have done him wrong; in his
thoughts, perhaps, he has done me wrong. And my niece, the only child of my dear
brother, sided with the stranger against me. I was wounded, sorely wounded; and
when I discovered that you and he were writing to each other secretly, I spoke
harshly to you; I may even have uttered some foolish threats. What man, my
child, can be ever wise, can ever say the right words, can ever do the right
things? None, not one, and I perhaps, who have peculiar moods and temper, less
than many. But see, now, what came of those harsh words, those foolish threats?
You still correspond with your friend Basil, and I stood quietly aside and
interfered not. Could I not have stopped the correspondence, if I had been
seriously determined to do so? Doubt it not, my child. At any moment I could
have done so. But I said, 'No, I will not spoil Annette's pleasure; it is an
innocent pleasure; let it go on; I will not interfere. One day my niece will do
me justice. And it may be, that one day her friend Basil and I will better
understand each other.' Is it not so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed, uncle,&quot; said Annette, timidly, &quot;it is I who have been
in the wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Gilbert, interrupting her, &quot;I will not have you
say so. The fault was mine. What say the English? You cannot put an old head on
young shoulders. I expected too much. From to-day we commence afresh. Eh, my
dear child?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, uncle.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So be it,&quot; he said, kissing her. &quot;We misunderstand each other
never again. It is agreed. Our friend Basil--I will make him my friend if he
will let me; you shall see--is coming home. He shall be welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Uncle, you remove a weight from my heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is what I would do, always. A weight is also removed from
mine. How long will our friend Basil be before he appears.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not know exactly. He will write.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will write,&quot; echoed Gilbert merrily, pinching Annette's
cheek. &quot;We have our secret post-office--ah, ah! Tell him it must be secret no
longer. Write openly to him; he shall write openly to you. He has been many
years in Australia. Has he grown rich on the goldfields? Did he find what they
call a golden claim?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He does not say; but I think he did not get rich there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not get rich there. Did he get rich anywhere, or does he come
poor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The picture of a needy adventurer rose before him, and had he
not been a master in cunning he would have betrayed himself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He writes,&quot; said Annette, &quot;that his uncle has left him a
large fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert drew a long breath of relief. Easier to cope with
Basil rich than poor. If Basil wanted Annette, and Annette wanted him, why, he
would make a bargain with the young man, who, being wealthy, would not be greedy
for Annette's money. Gilbert Bidaud was a keen judge of character, and he knew
Basil to be a manly, generous-hearted honourable fellow, who would be more
likely to despise than to covet money with the girl he loved. If that were so,
Gilbert saw a road to immunity for the past and a life of independence in the
future. There was a striking resemblance in certain features of his character
and that of Newman Chaytor, as there is in the natures of all purely selfish
men.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is a pleasant thing to hear,&quot; he said. &quot;I congratulate
him from my heart.&quot; He would have added, &quot;And I congratulate you,&quot; but he
restrained himself; it was delicate ground, and it would be better to wait.
Subsequently, in a conversation with his sister, he expressed himself more
freely. Basil would be received and welcomed--yes, but he would be carefully
sounded and observed, and she was to play her part both with Annette and her
lover. It pleased Gilbert to call him so, but it did not please the girl's aunt.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have foolish ideas,&quot; she said. &quot;Annette was thirteen
years when we took her from the plantation. What kind of love could a man have
for such a child?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will see, you will see,&quot; said Gilbert. &quot;This Basil is
what we call an eccentric, and it is because he is so that I have settled upon
the plan of bringing them together under our noses. Remember, my idiot of a
brother left me not a coin. We have our future to look to, and gentleman Basil
is the man to make it sure for us. Would you wish to have to slave for your
bread as you used to do--and often not get it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; but if I have an enemy I like him at a distance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Foolish woman! If I have an enemy I like him here, close to
me, where my hand can reach him. I will have him--if I have the choice--as I
have now--in the light, not in the dark.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Annette also had a conversation with her trusty maid Emily
concerning this new revelation in Gilbert Bidaud's character. Annette was very
enthusiastic about it, and very self-reproachful concerning the past, but Emily
looked grave and shook her head.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'd rather agree with you than not, miss,&quot; she said, &quot;but I
don't think I can about your uncle.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must not be obstinate and prejudiced, Emily,&quot; said
Annette, with mild severity.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll try not to be, miss, but if an animal is born a donkey,
a donkey he remains all the days of his life.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Annette laughed, and said, of course, but what <i>did</i>
Emily mean?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's a roundabout way of explaining myself,&quot; said Emily. &quot;And
there's different kinds of donkeys, some mild, and that'll take the whip as
patient as a wooden dummy; others that'll kick out and let fly at you with their
heels. The same with horses, the same with dogs, the same with cats.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What <i>do</i> you mean, Emily?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only when vice is in an animal you can't wheedle it out of
him. No more you can out of a man or a woman. I don't say they can help it, but
what's born in 'em <i>must</i> come out. If I'm born sly I keep sly, and the
chances are I grow slyer as I grow older. I don't believe in sudden changes,
miss, and if you'll excuse me I'll wait a little before I make up my mind about
your uncle.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_38" href="#div1Ref_38">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Newman Chaytor first met Annette in Paris. She wrote to him to
London, saying that her uncle intended to make a stay there of a few weeks, and
telling him the name of the hotel they stopped at. Chaytor's business in London
was by that time transacted and he was nervous to get away with his spoil. Bold
as he had been, and little as he believed he had to fear, there were moments
when he was seized with panic. What if Basil should not be dead? What if,
recovering, and being rescued from the tomb into which Chaytor had plunged him,
some suspicion should cross his mind of the treachery which had been practised
towards him? What if, after that, bent upon revenge, he should find his way
home, and there discover how he had been wronged and robbed? Newman Chaytor was
bathed in cold sweat, and his limbs shook as he contemplated this contingency.
In his calmer moments he strove to laugh himself out of his fears, but he never
entirely got rid of them, and he deemed it safer to live most of his time out of
England. For reasons of safety, also, he converted Basil's fortune into cash,
and carried a large portion of it upon his person in Bank of England notes. He
had clothes made after his own design, and in his waistcoats and trousers were
inner pockets in which he concealed his treasure. There were five bank notes of
a thousand pounds each, twenty of five hundred each, and the rest in hundreds
and fifties. They occupied but little space, and during the first month or two
of his coming into possession of the money, he was continually counting it in
the secresy of his room, with doors locked and windows shaded. The passing of a
cloud, the fluttering of a bird's wings across his window, the sound of
breathing or footstep outside his door, drove him into agonies of apprehension
as he was thus engaged. He would stop suddenly and listen, and creep to door or
window, and wait there till the fancied cause for fear was gone; then he would
resume his operations and pack the money away in the lining of his clothes. The
dread of losing it, of his being robbed, of its being wrested from him, was
never absent. When he entered a new hotel he examined the doors of his rooms,
tried the locks and fastenings, and peered about in every nook and corner, until
he was satisfied that there was no chink or loophole of danger. But as fast as
his fears were allayed in one direction they sprang up in another. The
hydra-headed monster he had created for himself left him no rest by day or
night. He slept with his clothes under his bolster, and waking up, would grope
in the dark with his hands to assure himself that they had not been taken away.
There were nights which were nothing less than one long terror to him. The
occupants of the apartments to the right and left of him were talkative; he
could not catch the sense of their words, but they were, of course, talking of
him. They were quiet; of course they were so to put him off his guard. He would
jump from his bed and stand, listening, and whether he heard sounds or heard
none, every existent and non-existent sign became a menace and a terror. As time
wore on it could not be but that these fears became less strong and vivid, but
they were never entirely obliterated, and were occasionally revived in all their
original force. There was, however, one new habit which he practised
mechanically, and of which he never got rid. This was a movement of the left
hand towards those parts of his clothing in which the money was concealed. He
was quite unconscious of the frequency of this peculiar motion, and took as
little notice of it as any man takes of the natural movements of his limbs.</p>

<p class="normal">When he received Annette's letter informing him that they were
in Paris he immediately resolved to go there. &quot;I am wondering,&quot; wrote Annette,
&quot;whether we shall see you here, or whether we shall have to wait because your
business is not finished. You must forget all that I have said about Uncle
Gilbert; we did not understand each other, but we do now, and he is very very
kind to me; and although he cannot be as anxious to see you as I am, he is ready
to give you a warm and hearty welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is an affectionate little puss,&quot; thought Chaytor, &quot;and
does not seem to conceal anything from her dear Basil, but if she thinks I am
going to tie myself to her apron strings she is mistaken. I will feel my way
with her, and--yes, a good idea! will have a peep at her somehow without her
seeing me, before I introduce myself. Judging from the photograph she sent me in
Australia&quot;--he was so accustomed to think of himself as Basil that he often
forgot he was Newman Chaytor--&quot;she is as pretty as a picture; but then portraits
are deceitful--like the originals. They are so touched up by the photographers,
that a very ordinary-looking woman is transformed into an angel. If that is the
case with Annette she will see very little of me. Give me beauty, bright eyes,
white teeth, a good figure, a pretty, kissable mouth, and I am satisfied. So, my
little Annette, it all depends upon yourself. As for Uncle Gilbert, it is a good
job that he is changed; it will make things easier for me. I don't want to
quarrel, not I, and if I take a fancy to Annette, and he can help to smooth the
way for me, why, all the better.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From the day he set foot on the vessel which brought him to
England, Chaytor had been most painstaking and careful about his appearance. He
spent hours before the glass arranging his hair after the fashion of Basil's
hair, as our hero had worn it in England; and, being a bit of an artist, he
succeeded perfectly. The resemblance was marvellous, and Chaytor congratulated
himself and chuckled at his cleverness. &quot;Upon my soul,&quot; he said, &quot;we must have
been changed at our birth. I am Basil, and he----&quot; He paused. No shudder passed
through him, he was visited by no pang of remorse at the thought of Basil lying
dead at the bottom of the shaft. It must have been very quick and sudden! Death
must have ensued instantaneously. Had he not listened and lingered, without a
sound of suffering, without even a sigh reaching him? &quot;No man could do more than
that,&quot; he thought. &quot;There's no telling what I should have done if he had groaned
or cried for help. But as he was dead and done for, what was the use of my
loitering there?&quot; Across the many thousands of miles of sea and land, his mental
vision travelled with more than lightning swiftness, and he saw at the bottom of
a dark shaft the form of his victim huddled up and still. And as he gazed, the
form unfolded itself, and rising to its feet, glided towards him. The vision had
presented itself once before, and he acted now as he had acted then. Almost
frenzied he dashed the phantom aside, with as much force as if Basil had stood
bodily before him, and, finding that this was of no avail, threw himself upon
the ground, and grovelled there with closed eyes until reason re-assumed its
sway and whispered that he was but the fool of fevered fancies. &quot;I shall go mad
if I don't mind,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I know what's the matter with me; I am keeping
myself too solitary. I want friends, companionship.&quot; It is a fact that he would
not make friends with any one; the fewer questions that were asked of him the
better. He was in constant dread of meeting with some person of whom Basil had
not spoken who would begin to speak of old times. Out of England this was not so
likely to occur. Man of pleasure as he was he had never been a heavy drinker,
but now he flew to brandy to deaden his fears. Altogether, despite his success,
he was not greatly to be envied. The lot of the poorest and most unfortunate of
men is to be preferred to that of a man of evil heart, whose Nemesis is ever by
his side throwing its black shadow over every conscious hour.</p>

<p class="normal">On the Continent Chaytor experienced some relief. He had
always been fond of Paris, and now he threw himself with zest into the pleasures
of that gay city. &quot;This is life,&quot; he said enthusiastically; &quot;it is for this I
have worked. Eureka! I have found the philosopher's stone--freedom, light,
enjoyment.&quot; He was in no hurry to go to Annette; he would have his fling
first--but, that, he said to himself, he would always have, Annette or no
Annette. His misfortune was that he could not rule circumstance. Gilbert Bidaud
set eyes on him as he was driving with some gay companions, for here in Paris
Chaytor was not so bent upon avoiding society as in England. &quot;Surely,&quot; mused the
elder fox, as he slipped into a carriage and gave the driver instructions to
follow Chaytor and his companions, &quot;that is my old friend Basil, for whom my
foolish niece is looking and longing. He presented himself to me in the
Australian wilderness as a model of perfection, a knight without a stain upon
his shield, but in Paris he appears to be very human. Very human indeed,&quot; he
repeated with a laugh, as he noted the wild gaiety of the man he was following.
Be sure that he did not lose sight of his quarry until he learnt as many
particulars concerning it as he could gain. So fox watched fox, and the game
went on, Annette waiting and dreaming of the Bayard without flaw and without
reproach who reigned in her heart of hearts.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you heard from our friend Basil?&quot; asked Gilbert Bidaud.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not for ten days,&quot; replied Annette. &quot;He said he feared he
would not have time to write again till he came to Paris, he was so beset with
lawyers and business men.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Gilbert; &quot;he must have much to do. He will
come to us, I hope, the moment he reaches Paris.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes, uncle; he will not wait a day, an hour; he will come
straight here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud nodded cheerfully, and said no more, but his
cunning mind was busy revolving pros and cons.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor, after awhile, carried out his resolution of seeing
Annette before he presented himself to her. Ascertaining the rooms she and her
people occupied, he engaged apartments for a couple of days in an hotel from the
windows of which he could observe her movements. He used opera glasses, and so
arranged his post of observation that he could not himself be seen. In the petty
minuti of small schemes, he was a master.</p>

<p class="normal">The first time he saw Annette he almost let his glasses fall
from his hand. Her radiant countenance, her sparkling eyes, the beauty of her
face, the grace of her movements, were a revelation to him. Never had he seen a
creature so lovely and perfect. So fascinated was he that he dreaded it might
not be Annette--but yes, there was her uncle, Gilbert Bidaud, standing now by
her side, and apparently talking pleasantly to her. Chaytor, though he had seen
the old man but once in the Australian woods, when he was a concealed witness of
the interview between Gilbert, Basil and Annette, recognised him immediately.
Gilbert Bidaud was not changed in the least, and Chaytor decided within himself
that neither Basil or Annette knew how to manage the old fellow. He, Newman
Chaytor, would be able to do so; he would be the master of the situation, and
would pull the strings of his puppets according to his moods and wishes. He did
not dream that Gilbert Bidaud was aware that he was in their vicinity, that he
even knew the number of the rooms he had engaged in the hotel, and the name he
had assumed for the purposes of his secret watch. From the moment that Gilbert
had set eyes upon him, every step he took, every movement he made, was noted
down by agents employed by the old man, who kept a written record for possible
use in the future. These two forces were well matched, but the odds were in
favour of the elder animal. &quot;It is clear,&quot; said Newman Chaytor, &quot;that Basil was
mistaken in his estimate of Gilbert Bidaud, and that he poisoned Annette's mind
against her uncle. The old man is harmless enough, and he and I will be great
friends.&quot; Presently Gilbert kissed his niece and left the room, laughing to
himself at the comedy scene he had played. His thoughts may also be put into
words.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is in that room, watching Annette. He has arranged the
curtains and the furniture in the manner most convenient for his watch. What is
his object, and what do his movements prove? He wishes to convince himself that
Annette is a bird attractive enough to follow, to woo, to win. If I knew what
has passed between them in the letters they wrote to each other, I should be
more certain of my conclusions, but as it is I shall not be far out. He wishes
also to observe me secretly, and to make up his mind about me before we come
together. Well, he shall have opportunity--he shall see what a kind pleasant
uncle I am. We were not the best of friends across the ocean--in good truth, we
were as bitter enemies as men could possibly be; and he remembers that we
exchanged hard and bitter words. Do I bear animosity? No; here, my dear friend,
is my hand: take it.&quot; He held it out, and the cunning of his nature was exposed
in the expression of his thin lips and his cold blue eyes. &quot;But what do his
movements prove? That, setting himself up as a gentleman, above doing a sly
action, profuse in his scorn of others and in glorification of himself, he is
the personification of low cunning and meanness. He deceived me when we clashed
in the forest; expressing scorn of him, and flinging mud upon his motives, I yet
believed him to be a gentleman, and was in my soul angry because the belief was
forced upon me. Bah! my friend Basil, my self-elected gentleman of honour
unblemished and untarnished, you are unmasked. You play your game; I will play
mine. We shall see who will win.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While these communings were going on Chaytor continued his
watch. His greedy eyes dwelt upon Annette's sweet face--heavens, he thought, how
beautiful she is!--his sinful soul gloated upon her grace of form and feature.
Would she know him when her eyes fell upon him? Would she see at once that he
was Basil, or was there anything in his appearance that would inspire a doubt?
That afternoon he examined himself narrowly in the glass; he practised Basil's
little tricks of motion, one of the most conspicuous of which was the caressing
of his moustache between finger and thumb, and any doubts he may have had
disappeared. &quot;I am more like Basil Whittingham than he ever was,&quot; he said. &quot;Even
in a court of law the chances would be all on my side.&quot; When he was in a
confident mood nothing more improbable could be conceived than that Basil would
ever cross his path. It was not improbable, it was impossible. Basil was dead,
and there was an end of the matter; he had all the field to himself.</p>

<p class="normal">He continued to observe Annette from his window, and the more
he saw of her the more constantly did his thoughts dwell upon her. During these
days he went through many rehearsals of the part he was playing, recalling all
that Basil had told him of his association with Annette, the scenes they had
walked through, the conversations they had indulged in. He was letter perfect in
what had passed between Basil and Annette's father, and his retentive memory had
preserved all the incidents in the scene in the Australian woods, when Gilbert
Bidaud and his sister had surprised them near Old Corrie's hut. &quot;Old Corrie,&quot;
thought Chaytor, &quot;had a down on me, and came near to spoiling my game, but I've
been more than a match for the lot of them. What has become of the old
busy-body? Dead, most likely. Everybody's as good as dead who could touch or
interfere with me. And Annette, the pretty Annette, is ready to fall into my
arms the moment I make my appearance.&quot; It will be remembered that on the last
meeting between Basil and Annette, she gave him a locket containing her mother's
portrait, and that, when Gilbert Bidaud flung it away into the bush, Newman
Chaytor picked it up and kept it close. From that day to this he had never
parted with it, and now, being about to present himself to Annette, he put it
round his neck, conscious that it would be a good card to play under any
circumstances.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_39" href="#div1Ref_39">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Annette was at lunch with her uncle and aunt in the public
room of the hotel when a gentleman entered, and took his seat at another table
close by. Annette, looking up from her plate, flushed rosy red, and in
uncontrollable excitement, started to her feet, then sank back into her chair
with her eyes fixed upon the newcomer. Gilbert Bidaud had also noted the
entrance of the gentleman, although his eyes seemed to be directed to another
part of the room; he took no outward notice, but inwardly said, &quot;Ah, ah, friend
Basil, you have decided at last to appear. Now for a few clever lies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Uncle!&quot; whispered Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, my niece,&quot; said Gilbert, &quot;what do you wish?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Look there uncle; look there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert looked in the desired direction and said, &quot;I see a
gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you not know who it is, uncle? Do you not recognise him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As I live,&quot; said Gilbert, &quot;I believe him to be our Australian
friend, Basil. But no--I may be deceived.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is he, uncle; it is he. Oh, why will he not look this
way?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At that precise moment, Chaytor, who was speaking to a waiter,
turned towards Annette, and their eyes met. He rose and walked towards her, with
a certain air of irresolution, but with an expression of eager delight in his
face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil!&quot; she cried, advancing to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it possible?&quot; exclaimed Chaytor, hugging himself with
satisfaction at this unhesitating recognition. It was not only that there were
no obstacles to remove, no awkward explanations to make, but it was a tribute to
his powers of duplicity, almost the crowning stone in the monument of deception
he had erected with so much skill. &quot;Annette!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, Basil, Basil!&quot; cried Annette, holding out her hands,
which he clasped in his. &quot;How happy I am to see you--how happy, how happy!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud, who had watched in silence the progress of
this comedy, now stepped forward.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must allow me to interfere,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not alone.
There are other ladies and gentlemen in the room, and their eyes are on you. We
will adjourn to our apartments.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He took Annette's hand and led the way, and in a few moments
they were able to converse without drawing upon themselves the attention of
strangers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will excuse me,&quot; said Gilbert to Chaytor with grave
courtesy, pointing to a chair, &quot;but I think this is better.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Infinitely better, M. Bidaud,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;and I thank you
for recalling me to myself. May I hope that you will shake hands with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Willingly. Let bygones be bygones. We did not understand each
other at the other end of the world; we will manage better at this end. When did
you arrive in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This morning. I travelled by the night mail.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lie the first,&quot; thought Gilbert Bidaud as he smiled and
nodded.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A weary journey, and I wanted to get rid of the stains of
travel before I presented myself. I was afraid, Annette--or I should rather now
say Miss Bidaud--might not recognise me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should have known you anywhere,&quot; said Annette softly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you, M. Bidaud?&quot; asked Chaytor, turning laughingly to the
old man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Anywhere, anywhere!&quot; cried Gilbert, enthusiastically. &quot;You
have the distinguished appearance, the grand air, which made me mistrust you on
my lamented brother's plantation. But we mistrusted each other, eh, friend
Basil?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, we did; but as you say, 'let bygones be bygones.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They shall be. If we speak of them it shall be to teach us
lessons. I will leave you and my niece together for, say, half-an-hour, and then
we will drive out. The day is fine--this re-union is fine--everything is fine.
My dear niece, I salute you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Annette's cup of happiness was full. She had experienced a
momentary pang when she heard herself called Miss Bidaud, but she knew that it
was right. She was no longer a child, and although she had always commenced her
letters with &quot;My dear Basil,&quot; she would have hesitated, now that they were
together, had she sat down to write to him. They had so much to talk about! All
the old days were recalled, and if once or twice Chaytor tripped, his natural
cleverness and Annette's assistance soon put him right. In such a matter as the
last meeting in the forest between Basil and Annette, of which he was a secret
witness, he was very exact, his faithful memory reproducing the smallest detail.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you remember this?&quot; he asked, showing her the locket.</p>

<p class="normal">She gazed at her mother's portrait with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was afraid it was lost,&quot; she said, &quot;when uncle threw it
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What a hunt I had for it,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;For hours and hours
did I look about, and almost despaired of finding it. I'll tell you what came
into my mind. If I don't find the locket I shall never see Annette again; if I
do, I shall. And when it was in my hands I looked upon it as a good omen. I
believe it has brought me straight to you. It has never left me; day and night I
have worn it round my neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Old Corrie helped you to find it,&quot; said Annette. &quot;Oh, yes, of
course, but it was I, not he, who first saw it. Lying among the leaves.
By-the-by, is that magpie still in the land of the living?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I have it in my room.&quot; Annette blushed as she spoke,
thinking of the endearing words of Basil she had taught the bird to speak. &quot;It
is all the dearer to me now that its poor master has gone.&quot; Then Chaytor began
to speak of his trials and troubles in Australia, and of his fear that he would
never be able to return to England.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I used to fret rarely over it,&quot; he said. &quot;I would not tell
you so in my letters, because I did not want to make you sad. But all that is
over now; I am rich, and there is nothing but happiness before us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing but happiness before us!&quot; Annette's heart beat
tumultuously as she heard those words. New hopes, new joys, were gathering, of
which she scarcely knew the meaning. She did not seek for it; it was sufficient
that Basil was with her, unchanged, the same dear friend he had ever been. They
had so much to say to each other that Gilbert Bidaud's entrance at the end of
half an hour was an unwelcome interruption.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, come, young people,&quot; he said merrily, &quot;the bright sun
invites us. You can talk as we ride.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His voice was benignant, his manner paternal, and during the
ride he did not intrude upon them. That night Annette went to bed a perfectly
happy woman. No doubts or fears beset her. She was conscious of a certain
undefinable change in Basil which she could not exactly explain to herself. His
voice appeared to be in some way altered; it was scarcely so gentle as it used
to be, and there was a difference also in his manner of speech. But she did not
dwell upon these impressions; the change was more likely in her than in him; she
had grown, she had ripened, childhood's days were over. Then Basil had passed
through much suffering, and had been for years in association with rough men.
What wonder if his manners were less refined than she remembered them to be? But
his heart was unchanged; he was the same Basil as of old--tender, devoted, and
as deeply attached to her as she had dared to hope. Emily, assisting her young
mistress to undress, found her less conversational than usual. She divined the
cause, and was sympathetically quiet, asking but few questions, and listening
with unaffected interest to what Annette had to say. Emily had not yet seen
Basil, but her views with respect to him were fixed; she was quite ready to
subscribe to Annette's belief that he was above the standard of the ordinary
mortal, and she had set her heart upon its being a match between them; and when,
while she was assisting her mistress, she saw her, in the glass, smile happily
to herself, as one might do who was under the influence of a happy dream, she
was satisfied that some progress had already been made towards the desired end.</p>

<p class="normal">As for Newman Chaytor, he left Annette that night in a very
contented, not to say ecstatic, frame of mind. There had not been a hitch; he
had passed through the examination with flying colours. He approved not only of
himself, he approved of Annette. She was beautiful from a distance, but far more
than beautiful did she prove to be when he came into association with her; her
winning voice, her tenderness, her charm of manner, made as deep an impression
upon him as a nature so entirely selfish as his was capable of receiving. It was
not possible that he could entertain true and sincere love for any human being,
but Annette inspired within him those feelings which took the place of such a
love. &quot;She has bewitched me,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't drive her out of my thoughts,
and don't want to, the little darling! Basil, my double, had a good eye for the
future. He saw what she would grow into, and intended to save her for himself;
and so he has, for I am he. My other self, I drink to you!&quot; It was in the
solitude of his chamber that he communed thus with himself. Brandy and water
were before him; he mixed a stiff glass in which to drink the toast, and raised
it to his lips as he uttered the last words. Scarcely had the glass touched his
lips when it fell to the ground and was shattered to pieces. There before him
was the vision of the shaft with the dead body of his other self lying at the
bottom. It rose and moved towards him. &quot;Curse you!&quot; he cried. &quot;Can I never get
rid of you?&quot; A silent voice answered him: &quot;Never, while you live. I am the
shadow of your crime. I shall be with you--dogging you, haunting you--to the
last hour of your sinful life!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_40" href="#div1Ref_40">CHAPTER XL.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud was puzzled. As well as any man in the world
did he know the true metal when he saw it, and when he was in doubt and had the
opportunity of applying tests he did so, and thus resolved his doubts. He had
done so in the case of Newman Chaytor, with the result that he proved the metal
to be spurious; and still he was not satisfied with the proof. There was
something behind the scenes which was hidden from him, and with all his
cleverness he could not obtain sight of it.</p>

<p class="normal">His acquaintance with Basil in Australia had been brief, but
he had learnt in that short time to hate him most cordially. This hatred was
intensified by the conviction that forced itself upon him that Basil was a
straightforward, honourable gentleman. Gilbert Bidaud never allowed his
prejudices to blind him and obscure his judgment. When he found himself in a
difficult position he was careful that his view of the circumstances with which
he had to contend was a clear one, and whatever discomfort he might bring upon
himself by this course it was invariably of assistance to him in the end he
desired to attain. Recognising in Basil the gentleman and the man of honourable
impulse he knew exactly where to sting him and how to cope with him. Looking
forward to association with Basil in Europe he had schooled himself beforehand
as to the methods to pursue with respect to him. But these methods were not
necessary. The Basil between whom and himself there was now regular intercourse,
was a different Basil from the man he had known across the seas, easier to
manage and grapple with. So far, so good, but it did not content Gilbert Bidaud.
By no process of reasoning could he reconcile the opposing characteristics of
the man he had to fear. Where Basil was straight Chaytor was crooked, where he
was manly and independent Chaytor was shy and cringing. The physical likeness
was sufficiently striking to deceive the world; the moral likeness could deceive
very few, and certainly not for long an intellect like Gilbert Bidaud's. They
had been intimate now many months, and Chaytor was regarded as one of the the
family. Beneath the tests which Gilbert employed his character had gradually
unfolded itself. He drank, he gambled, he dissipated, and in all his vices
Gilbert led him on and fooled him to the top of his bent, the elder man becoming
every day more convinced that there was here a mystery which it would be useful
to himself to unfold. All he wanted was a starting point, and it was long before
it presented itself; but it came at last.</p>

<p class="normal">The rift of light shone on a day when Gilbert Bidaud had taken
it into his head to direct the conversation to the first time he and Basil had
met. Chaytor and Gilbert were alone, and had just finished a match at piquet,
which left the more experienced gamester of the two a winner of a couple of
hundred pounds. Chaytor was in a vile temper; he was a bad loser, and Gilbert
had won a considerable sum of him within the last few weeks. Had his brain been
as evenly balanced as that of his antagonist he would have recognised in him a
superior player, and would have declined to play longer with him for heavy
stakes, but, unluckily for himself, he believed he was the equal of any man in
games of skill, and the worst qualities of pride were aroused by his defeats.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Curse your luck!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will turn, it will turn,&quot; said Gilbert, complacently; &quot;it
cannot last with so good a player as yourself. If we had even cards I should
have a poor chance with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He poured out brandy for Chaytor and claret for himself.
Liquor was always handy when these two were together, and Gilbert never drank
spirits. Chaytor emptied his glass, and Gilbert sipped at his and then directed
the conversation to their first meeting on the plantation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must remember it well,&quot; said Gilbert.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course I do,&quot; said Chaytor, ungraciously, helping himself
to more brandy. &quot;One doesn't soon forget his dealings with Mr. Gilbert Bidaud.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes, I make myself remembered,&quot; said Gilbert, laughing
with an affectation of good-humour. &quot;For me, I have never forgotten that
alligator. I can see it now, lying without motion among the reeds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are you driving at?&quot; exclaimed Chaytor, to whom, as it
happened, Basil had never given any account of the details of this first meeting
with Gilbert Bidaud. &quot;If you want to humbug me you will have to get up earlier
in the morning, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, that is certain,&quot; said Gilbert, continuing to laugh, but
with a strange thoughtfulness in his observance of Chaytor. &quot;I was only
recalling an incident that occurred on the morning I arrived on the plantation.
We had tramped through the bush, my sister and I, my poor brother having urged
us to hasten, and we arrived early in the morning, tired and dusty. Before us
stretched a river, and, leaving my sister to rest beneath the wide-spread
branches of a tree, I sought a secluded spot where I could bathe. I undressed
and was about to plunge into the water, when I beheld lurking among the reeds a
monstrous alligator. A workman on the plantation chancing to pass that way, ran
down the bank and seized my arm, and pointing to the alligator, said, with
reference to a remark I made about being ready for my breakfast, that instead of
eating I might be eaten. It was kind of that workman to make the attempt to save
me. If it had been you, friend Basil, you might not just then have been so
anxious to deprive the monster of a savoury meal.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is pretty certain,&quot; acquiesced Chaytor, with a sneer,
&quot;that I should have left you to your fate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now that is frank and honest,&quot; said Gilbert, &quot;and what I like
in you. Not for you the trouble of meaning one thing and saying another. It was
not unlikely, however, that this kind workman, one of the labourers on the
plantation, might have mentioned this incident of the alligator to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whether it was or wasn't, he didn't mention it. This is the
first time I have heard the interesting story.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, it <i>is</i> interesting, is it not? It was from this
same obliging workman that I learnt many particulars of my brother's domestic
affairs, of which I was ignorant, having been so long separated from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And then Gilbert Bidaud, with something more than a suspicion
that he had his fingers on the pulse of the mystery which was perplexing him,
recapitulated, as nearly as he could recall them, all the particulars of the
conversation between Basil and himself on this occasion of their first meeting,
with not one of which was Chaytor familiar. Chaytor, continuing to drink,
listened contemptuously to this &quot;small talk,&quot; as he termed it, and wanted to
know why Gilbert Bidaud bored him with such stuff; but the old man continued,
and finally wound up with an invented account of a meeting with Basil on the
plantation, to which Chaytor, ignorant of what was true and what was false,
willingly subscribed, and thus materially assisted in the deception that was
being practised upon him. At length Gilbert Bidaud rose with the intention of
taking his leave.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And how goes matters,&quot; he asked, &quot;with you and my niece? Does
the course of true love still run smooth?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never you mind,&quot; retorted Chaytor, &quot;whether it does or
doesn't. It isn't your affair.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps not. You are not in a gracious humour, friend Basil.
We will speak of it another time. Do not forget that I am Annette's guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, no, I'll not forget. When she and I settle things I shall
want some information from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About----?&quot; asked Gilbert, and paused.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About her fortune. You see, up till now, my friend, you have
had it all your own way.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;True, true. We will speak of it. Oh, yes, we will speak of
it,&quot; adding inly, &quot;and of other things as well, my mysterious friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The remaining portion of that day Gilbert Bidaud devoted
himself to thought, the subject being the man who called himself Basil
Whittingham. This, with him, was a distinct process; he had cultivated the art
of marshalling facts and evidence, of weighing their relative value and their
direct and indirect bearing upon the problem he was endeavouring to solve, and
of imparting into it all the arguments which would naturally suggest themselves
to an intellect so subtle and astute as his own. &quot;Outside,&quot; thought Gilbert, &quot;he
is Basil, the man I knew; inside he is not Basil, the man I knew. The outside of
a man may change, but it is against nature that his character should be twisted
inside out--that it should turn from white to black, from black to white. In my
estimate of Basil on my brother's plantation I was not mistaken; and that being
so, this man and that man are not the same inwardly. How stands my niece in
regard to him? She was all joy when he first joined us; it was nothing but
Basil, Basil, Basil, like the magpie that the old woodcutter gave her. But her
joy and gladness have not stood the test of time; my niece has grown sad. I have
seen her watch Basil's face with grief in her own; I have seen her listen to his
conversation with sadness and surprise in her eyes. She says nothing, she nurses
her grief, and is the kind of woman that will sacrifice herself to an idea, to a
passion she regards as sacred. Yes, this Basil is not the Basil she knew--and
she knew him well and intimately, far better than I. That one was capable of
noble deeds--though I hated him I will do him justice; this one is sordid, mean,
debased, depraved. Fruit ripens and rots; not so men's hearts. Where there is
sweetness it is never wholly lost; some trace of it remains, and so with
frankness, generosity, and nobility. Has this Basil shown the least moral
indication that he is the man we knew? Not one. All the better for me, perhaps.
He will want some information from me respecting Annette's fortune, will he? I
may want some information from him. He will dictate to me, will he? Take care,
my friend, I may dictate to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The result of his cogitations was that he made a little
experiment. For some time past a celebrated case of personation, in which the
fortunes of an old family and estate were involved, had been the theme of
conversation and speculation all the world over; and, curiously enough, the man
who caused this excitement hailed from Australia. The trial had just commenced,
and the newspapers were full of it. Armed with a bundle of papers, Gilbert
Bidaud presented himself to Chaytor. Throwing them on the table, he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never have I been so interested, never has there been such a
case before the public. How will it end? that is the question--how will it end?
You and I, who are students of human nature, who can read character as we read
books, even we must be puzzled and perplexed. Why, what have you there? As I
live, you have been purchasing the same papers as myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was true that there were English newspapers scattered about
the room of the same dates as those Gilbert Bidaud had brought in with him, and
that their appearance indicated that Chaytor had perused them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An Englishman may buy an English newspapers I suppose,&quot; said
Chaytor, a little uneasily, &quot;without its being considered in any way remarkable.
What particular case are you referring to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An Englishman, my dear friend,&quot; replied Gilbert, with
exceeding urbanity, &quot;may purchase every English newspaper there is for sale in
the city if he is so inclined. This is the particular case to which I refer.&quot; He
pointed to the columns upon columns of the reports of the case, taking up one
paper after another and laying them all down carefully a-top of each other with
the case in question uppermost, till he had gathered together every newspaper in
the room, and had arranged them in one pile. While he was thus employed he did
not fail to note that Chaytor's face had grown white, and that he was also
watching Gilbert Bidaud in fear and secresy. Gilbert Bidaud laughed softly, as
he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Study this case, my dear friend. Watch its progress--consider
it well. But perhaps it is not necessary for one so deep, so clever as yourself.
You have already made up your mind how it will end. Make me as wise as yourself,
friend of my soul.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He laid his hand upon Chaytor's arm, and gazed steadily into
the traitor's eyes, which wavered in the observance.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How should I know,&quot; exclaimed Chaytor, shaking off Gilbert's
hand, &quot;how it will end?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay, my dear friend,&quot; said Gilbert, and once more he laid his
hand upon Chaytor's arm, &quot;do not shake me off so rudely. You and I are friends,
are we not? We can serve each other; I may be useful to you--yes, yes, very,
very useful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was one who placed a high value upon small tests, and he
had laid his hand upon Chaytor's arm the second time with a deliberate and
distinct purpose. If the man before him was really and truly Basil, he could not
possibly misunderstand the covert threat which the action and the tone in which
he spoke conveyed. Having nothing to fear, he would show resentment,
indignation, and would release himself immediately from Gilbert's grasp. Newman
Chaytor did nothing of the kind; inwardly shaking with mortal dread, he allowed
Gilbert's hand to remain, and for a few moments neither of the men spoke. During
this brief silence Gilbert knew that the game was his, and that he had nothing
to fear from Chaytor's threat concerning the management of Annette's fortune. He
was too wise to push his advantage. With a light laugh, he threw the pile of
newspapers into a corner of the room, and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What matter to us how the case ends? If it is against him, he
is a fool; if it is for him, he deserves to win; in either case whether he be or
be not the man, we will not discuss it. Our own affairs are for us sufficient.
Is it not so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Chaytor sullenly. He would not have answered
had not Gilbert looked up at him and compelled him to speak.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I love the daring deed,&quot; continued Gilbert; &quot;my soul responds
to him who conceives and carries it out, and if there is danger in the execution
it is to me all the grander. I have myself been daring in my time, and had I not
been successful rue would have been my portion. You and I, my dear friend, have
in our nature some resemblance; we view life and human matters with the eye of a
philosopher. Life is short--ah! I envy you; your feet have scarcely passed the
threshold; I am far on the way. For you the summer, for me the winter. Well,
well, there are some years before me yet, and I will exercise our philosophy by
enjoying them. I look to myself; let other men do the same. Nature says aloud,
'Enjoy the sunshine.' I obey nature. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy--that is the true
teaching; and you, dear friend, are of my opinion. Let this proclaim that we are
comrades.&quot; He held out his hand, which Chaytor felt restrained to take. &quot;That is
well; it is safer so. And attend. I pry not into your secrets, and you will not
pry into mine. Of our cupboards with their skeletons we will each keep our key.
What I choose to reveal I reveal; as with you. Beyond that boundary we do not
step.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had not uttered a compromising word, but Chaytor understood
him thoroughly. How much, or how little, he knew, Chaytor could not say, but
that he could be a most dangerous enemy was clear. He was not a man from whom
one could escape easily, and, even if he were, Chaytor was not in the humour to
make the attempt. The impression which Annette's grace and beauty had made upon
him was so strong that he could not endure the idea of leaving her. The
relations between them had not been those of lovers: they had been of an
affectionate nature, but no words binding them to each other had passed between
them. Gilbert Bidaud was correct in his observation of her. Joyous and bright at
first, she had grown sad and quiet. A shadow had fallen upon the ideal she had
worshipped; and yet she did not dare to blame the Basil who had reigned in her
heart pure and undefiled. Was he still so? She would not answer the question;
when it presented itself she refused to listen. With a sad shake of her head she
strove to deaden her senses against the still small voice which ever and again
intruded the torturing doubt, but she could not dismiss it entirely. Basil she
loved, Basil she would always love; was it not treason to love to admit the
whispered doubt that he was changed? She argued sometimes that the change was in
her, and wondered whether he observed in her what she observed in him. She asked
him once:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Am I changed, Basil!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are more beautiful and charming than ever, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They had had a little conversation, in which Gilbert Bidaud
took part, as to calling each other by their Christian names, and Gilbert had
settled the question.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is too cold,&quot; he said, &quot;this Miss Bidaud, this Mr.
Whittingham. You proclaim yourself strangers. Let it be as it was, as it always
shall be, Basil and Annette. Always, always, Basil and Annette. Children, be
happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was as though he had given them a fatherly benediction.
From the day of the last recorded interview between Gilbert Bidaud and Newman
Chaytor, the intimacy between them grew still closer. Gilbert managed that, and
also so contrived matters that, without any open declaration being made, no one
could doubt that Chaytor and Annette were unavowed lovers. Gilbert had decided
that it would be best and safest for him that they should marry. He had Chaytor
in his power, and could make a bargain with him which would ensure him ease and
comfort for his remaining years. With another man it would not be so easy; he
would have to render an account of his stewardship, and in this there was
distinct danger. He was very curious to arrive at the real truth respecting
Chaytor, and despite his assurance that he would not pry into Chaytor's secret,
he was continually on the watch for something that would help to reveal it to
him. Chaytor, however, was on his guard, and Gilbert learnt nothing further.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Next week,&quot; he said to Chaytor, &quot;we go to Villa Bidaud. The
summer is waning, and the climate there is warm and agreeable. You accompany
us?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where Annette goes I go,&quot; said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet,&quot; said Gilbert, with a certain wary thoughtfulness,
&quot;matters should be more definitely arranged before you become absolutely one of
our family circle. I have spoken of this before. You are neither brother nor
cousin--what really would you be to her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know what I would really be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know, but at present it is locked in a box. If you tarry
too long you will lose her. I perceive that that would be a blow; and well it
might be, for she is a prize a king would be proud to win. Shall we decide it
this evening?&quot; Chaytor nodded. &quot;Join us at nine o'clock, and we will settle the
matter. It may be advisable that I speak first to Annette. She may need
management. I will give you a word of warning. If it goes according to your
wish, be more careful in your behaviour. Think a little less of yourself, a
little more of her. Be tender, considerate, thoughtful, for a time at least,
until you are secure of her. Then it is your affair and hers, and I shall have
nought to do with either of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will take care of that,&quot; thought Chaytor, and said aloud,
&quot;You think I need your warning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know you need it. You have either small regard for women,
or you are clumsy in your management of them. Before I leave you now, I wish you
to sign this paper.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was a document, carefully worded, which Gilbert Bidaud had
drawn out, by which Chaytor bound himself to make no demand upon Annette's
guardian for any money or property, which had fallen to Annette upon her
father's death. It was in fact, a renunciation of all claims in the present or
the future.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why should I sign this?&quot; asked Chaytor rebelliously.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because it is my wish,&quot; replied Gilbert.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I refuse?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In the first place, you will lose Annette. In the second
place, something worse than that will happen to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Through you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Through me. I have a touch of the bloodhound in me. Take
heed. Only in alliance with me are you safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was a bold hazard, but it succeeded. Without another word,
Chaytor signed the paper.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Basil Whittingham,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, examining the
signature, and uttering the name with significant emphasis. &quot;Good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">That evening the engagement between Annette and Chaytor was
ratified in the presence of Gilbert Bidaud and his sister. The old man had a
long conversation with his niece before Chaytor made his appearance. He told her
that Basil had formally proposed for her hand, and that knowing her heart was
already given to the young man, he had accorded his consent to their union. He
spoke in great praise of Basil's character, and skilfully alluded to certain
matters which he knew Annette was grieving over.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have observed a change in Basil,&quot; he said, &quot;so have I;
but you, my dear niece, are partly responsible for it. The truth is, Basil was
fearful of the manner in which you would receive his declaration. He loves you
with so deep and profound a love, and he sets so high a value upon you, that he
hardly dared to hope. The uncertainty of his position has made him forget
himself; he has committed excesses; he has behaved as if he were not Basil, but
another man. You, my dear child, with your simple heart, are ignorant of the
vagaries which love's fever, and the fear of disappointment, play in a man's
nature. They transform him, and only when his heart is at ease, and he is
satisfied that his love is returned, does his better, his higher self return.
But for this fear Basil would perhaps have unfolded his heart to you without any
intervention, though he has behaved like an honourable man in speaking first to
me. You will be very, very happy, my child. I bless you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Only too ready was Annette to accept this explanation.
Implicitly believing in it, and not for one moment suspecting guile or
duplicity, she felt her faith and her best hopes restored. When Chaytor came to
her, he was for awhile humbled by her sweetness and modesty, and what
deficiencies there were in him Annette supplied them out of her faith and trust.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is a little formality,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, intruding
upon the lovers. &quot;It is a custom in our family to sign a preliminary marriage
contract. Affix your signatures here--you, Basil Whittingham, you, Annette
Bidaud. It is well. Before the year is out, we will have a wedding.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Within a week they were in Switzerland, settled in the Villa
Bidaud.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_41" href="#div1Ref_41">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">Annette did not remain long in her delusion. Gradually, but
surely her bright hopes faded away, to be replaced by a terrible feeling of
hopeless resignation. The serpent cannot change its nature, and the worst
features in Newman Chaytor's character began to assert themselves soon after the
signing the document which Gilbert Bidaud had described as the preliminary
marriage contract. He was sure of Annette; what need, therefore, for the wearing
of an irksome mask? He threw it aside, and exhibited himself in his true
colours, to the grief and despair of the girl he had successfully deceived. She
heard him, in conversation with her uncle, use language and utter sentiments at
which her soul revolted; she saw him frequently the worse for liquor; and often
now she purposely avoided him when he sought her society. Brightness died out of
the world, and she thought shudderingly of the future. The flowers in her young
heart were withered. And yet she dwelt mournfully upon the image of the man she
had adored, and asked herself, Can it be possible--can it be possible? The
answer was there, in the same house with her, sitting by her side, pressing her
hand, while he uttered coarse jokes, or gazing darkly at Gilbert Bidaud, who was
ever ready to give smiles for frowns. For this was the old man's method; he was
urbane and light-hearted in the family circle, and nothing that Chaytor said
could disturb his equanimity. He had the traitor in his toils, and he played his
game with the air of an indulgent master.</p>

<p class="normal">The Villa Bidaud was a great rambling house of two storeys,
standing in its own grounds. It was surrounded by a high stone wall, and stood
far back from the public road; when the strong iron gates were locked it
resembled a prison. Annette, chilled at heart, began to feel that it was one and
but for the companionship of her faithful maid Emily, her life would have been
dark and gloomy indeed. It was a relief to her when her uncle announced that he
and the man to whom she was betrothed were going away on business for two or
three weeks.</p>

<p class="normal">Their mission was special and important, and has been
attempted by hundreds of other gulls. Gilbert Bidaud had discovered a system by
which he could break the bank at Monte Carlo. The one diversion of the two
knaves at the Villa Bidaud was gambling. Never a day passed but they were
closeted together in a locked room rattling the dice or shuffling the cards. It
may be questioned whether the demon of play is not more potent than the demon of
drink, and it is certain that it had so fastened itself upon Newman Chaytor that
he could not escape from it. His losses maddened him, but his infatuation led
him on to deeper and deeper losses, Gilbert Bidaud always declaring that the
luck must change and that the money Chaytor lost was only money lent.
Occasionally he professed indifference to the fatal pastime, and lured Chaytor
on to persuasion, replying, &quot;Well, as you insist.&quot; One day Chaytor, as usual,
was savagely growling at his ill-luck, when Gilbert said carelessly: &quot;You can
get it all back, ten, twenty, a hundred-fold, if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How?&quot; eagerly demanded Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">Then Gilbert unfolded his plan. He had made a wonderful
discovery, an absolutely infallible system by which fortunes could be won at the
roulette tables of Monte Carlo and elsewhere. Chaytor caught at the bait, but
with smaller cunning threw doubt upon it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can demonstrate it,&quot; said Gilbert. &quot;I have here a
roulette table to which I have not yet introduced you, and upon which I have
proved my figures. You shall take the bank, and I will carry out my system. We
will play for small stakes. What say you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor suggested that the stakes should be imaginary, but to
this the cleverer knave would not agree.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You insist that the bank must win,&quot; he said. &quot;Take the bank
and try.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They played for three days, during which, as luck would have
it, Gilbert rose invariably a winner. At the end of the third day, he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;See now. I have won from you an average of one hundred pounds
a day. All we have to do at Monte Carlo is to increase the stakes, and we can
win as much as we please. Say, to be moderate, three thousand pounds a day.
Fifty days, one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Seventy five thousand each.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor was eager to begin, but there was first a bargain to
be struck. In return for the fortune they were to win, and of which Chaytor was
to have an equal share, Gilbert Bidaud stipulated that his partner should
provide the funds for the venture. At first Chaytor refused, but when Gilbert
said, &quot;Very well, there is an end of the matter,&quot; he implored to be admitted
upon the stipulated terms.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We commence with a bank of five thousand pounds,&quot; said
Gilbert.</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor drew a long face at mention of this sum, but he was in
the toils and avarice compelled compliance. On the morning of their departure he
handed over the amount in Bank of England notes, it being another of Gilbert's
conditions that he should be the treasurer. Now, on the previous day, after
Chaytor had consented to provide the five thousand pounds, Gilbert had resolved
to ascertain where he was in the habit of concealing his treasure. It was easy
enough to carry out this resolve. The Villa Bidaud was an old house, with the
peculiarities of which Gilbert had made himself familiar at the time he
purchased it. In one part of the room in which Chaytor slept, the wall was
double, an outer panel admitting of the entrance of any person who wished to
play the spy. All he had to do was to ascend three steps, when an artfully
concealed peep-hole enabled him to see all the movements of the occupant of the
inner room. From that point of observation Gilbert watched Chaytor's
proceedings; saw him carefully lock the door and mask the keyhole, so that no
one could see into the room through it; saw him as carefully cover the windows
and render himself safe in that direction; saw him take his hoard of banknotes
from the artfully-contrived pockets in his clothes, count them over, place a
small pile aside, and return the balance to its hiding-place. Gilbert saw
something more. He beheld Chaytor suddenly pause and look before him, while upon
his features gathered a convulsed and horror-stricken expression, as though he
was gazing on some appalling phantom. It was at such a moment that the character
of Chaytor's face became entirely changed, all likeness to Basil being
completely obliterated. Chaytor's arms were stretched out in the act of
repelling a presence visible only to himself; his limbs trembled, a cold sweat
bathed his countenance, and he exhibited all the symptoms of a man in the throes
of a mortal agony.</p>

<p class="normal">Slowly and thoughtfully Gilbert left his post and returned to
his own apartment. His suspicions were absolutely confirmed, so far as the
evidence he had obtained could confirm them. On the following morning he and
Chaytor took their departure.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They part from us without regret,&quot; he observed as they rode
away. &quot;Who are they?&quot; asked Chaytor, in a morose tone. He knew to whom his
companion referred. Annette had exhibited no concern when he informed her that
business compelled a separation of a couple of weeks. She had received this
intimation in silence, and when he kissed her good bye had not returned his
kiss. He inwardly resolved that when he and Annette were married she should pay
for her growing coldness towards him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was thinking of my niece,&quot; replied Gilbert. &quot;She displayed
but small grief at the departure of her lover. And such a lover!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor looked sharply at him, for there was a touch of
sarcasm in his voice, but Gilbert's countenance was expressionless.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Women are queer cattle,&quot; he said roughly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;True, true,&quot; assented Gilbert, &quot;and cattle must be taught to
know who are their masters. Bah! We will not talk of them. Let us rather talk of
the fortune we are pursuing and shall overtake.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">So they fell to discussing this most agreeable theme, and
indulging in visions of vast gains. Chaytor did not know what his companion
knew--that the &quot;system&quot; discovered by Gilbert would have been really a certain
thing but for one combination or series of figures which might not be drawn for
many days together.</p>

<p class="normal">It was upon the chance of this series not presenting itself
that Gilbert relied; if they escaped it, their purses would be filled; if it
occurred, it was not his money that would be lost.</p>

<p class="normal">No time was wasted at Monte Carlo: within an hour of their
arrival they commenced to play, and before they retired to rest they counted
their winnings.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; asked Gilbert gaily.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; replied Chaytor, feverishly fingering the gold and
notes. &quot;We must win more, more!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We will. The world is at our feet. Let us divide.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This was a part of Gilbert's plan; the winnings of each day
were to be divided; thus he made sure of gain to himself, whatever might happen
to his partner. For some days their operations prospered, and then came the
inevitable bad experience. They sustained a loss, another, another; a large sum
had to be staked to recover their losses, and that also was swept in by the
croupiers, upon whose stony faces ruin and despair produced no impression.
Chaytor stormed and reviled, and Gilbert listened with calmness to his
reproaches. In desperation the younger man took the game in hand himself, and
plunged wildly at the tables, Gilbert looking on in silence. The result was
that, after a fortnight had passed, Chaytor had lost ten thousand pounds of his
ill-gotten wealth.</p>

<p class="normal">Nearly half the fortune of which he had obtained fraudulent
possession was gone. With a gloomy countenance he counted what remained; his
heart was filled with bitterness towards his companion, whose design it was to
lead Chaytor on step by step until his ruin was complete. For a little while
Chaytor contemplated flight, but so unwearying was the watch kept on him by
Gilbert, that, had he nerved himself determinedly to his design, he could not
have put it in execution. Besides, the thought of Annette held him back. No, he
would not fly, he would return to the Villa Bidaud, he would marry Annette, he
would compel Gilbert to make restitution of his niece's fortune, and then he
would bid farewell for ever to his evil genius and take Annette to America,
where he would commence a new life.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have had enough of this,&quot; he said to Gilbert. &quot;If I
followed your counsels any longer I should land in the gutter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not so, not so,&quot; responded the unruffled Gilbert; &quot;if you
were guided by me you would land in a palace. See, now, I kept a record of the
numbers while you were so recklessly staking your money on this chance and that,
throwing away, like a madman, the certainty I offered you. You know my system;
sit down with these numbers before you, follow them, back them according to my
notation, and discover how you would have got back all your losses, and been in
the end a large gainer. I leave you for an hour to the lesson I set you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor applied himself to the task, with a savage desire to
prove by mathematical demonstration that his associate had robbed him, and
finding that Gilbert was right and that by following the system he would have
recovered his money, cursed his luck, and Gilbert, and all the world. His
paroxysm of anger abated, a sense of comfort stole upon him. When he had freed
himself from the shackles which Gilbert had thrown around him, when Annette was
his and he and she were alone, he would come back to Monte Carlo and carry out
on his sole account the system he had so foolishly abandoned. Then all the money
that was won would be his own: there would be no Gilbert Bidaud to cheat him of
half. &quot;Have you verified my figures?&quot; asked the old man, returning. &quot;Have you
established your folly?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; replied Chaytor, thrusting the paper upon which he made
his calculations into his pocket, &quot;you have deceived and tricked me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, ah,&quot; ejaculated Gilbert, in a light and pleasant tone, &quot;I
have deceived and tricked you--and you have seen through me! Clever Basil,
clever Basil! I am as a child in your hands. Come, let us get back to our dear
Annette. Let us fly on the wings of love.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They had not announced their intended return, and their
arrival at the villa Bidaud was therefore unexpected. The gates were unlocked
for them by a servant, and they entered the grounds. Gilbert took the keys from
the man, and relocked the gates.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are precious careful,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;Are you frightened
of thieves?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am old,&quot; said Gilbert, with a smile; &quot;I am losing my nerve.
We stopped at the post-house, did we not, to inquire for letters?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You heard me speak to the woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You were talking, I know, but I did not hear what passed
between you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your thoughts were on our sweet Annette. Why is she not here
to receive us? Why does she not fly into our arms? Ah, I forgot. We did not
write that we were coming. Yes, I spoke to the woman at the post-house; I asked
her for the news.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;News in this den!&quot; exclaimed Chaytor, scornfully. &quot;One might
as well be out of the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Out of the world--yes, out of the world. Speak not of it; I
have passed the sixties.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I tell you what,&quot; said Chaytor, with a gloomy look around, &quot;I
don't intend to keep here much longer. It is as much like a tomb as any place I
have ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There again, there again! Out of the world, and tombs. You
mock the old man. What was I saying when you interrupted me? Ah, about the woman
at the post-house. I asked her for news, and she told me that three strangers
had been seen this afternoon in the village.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Rare news that. She might have saved her breath.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Everything is news in these small villages. Now, why is it
that my mind dwells upon these strangers? Such visits are common enough.
Doubtless they are but passing through, and we shall hear no more of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then why keep talking about them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Gently, gently. I had a bad dream last night, I saw you
pursued by foes, and I hastened after you in my dreams to assist you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;More than you would do if you were awake.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You misjudge me. But to continue. How many foes were pursuing
you? Three. How many strangers appeared in the village this afternoon? Three.
See you any warning, any hidden danger in this?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a coincidence, nothing more,&quot; replied Chaytor, with an
uneasy shifting of his body. &quot;Look here--I am not going to stand this, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are not going to stand what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This infernal badgering--this attempt to make me
uncomfortable. Haven't I enough to worry me as it is? What do I care about your
dreams and your three strangers?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I want to make you comfortable--and happy; yes, very, very
happy. And you will be if you do not quarrel with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And if I <i>do</i> quarrel with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud toyed musingly with a charm on Chaytor's watch
chain. &quot;Be advised. Keep friends with me, the best of friends. Old as I am, it
is not safe to quarrel with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, tush!&quot; cried Chaytor, vainly endeavouring to conceal his
discomposure. &quot;Have you done with your post-woman and her three strangers?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not quite. I made further inquiries about them and learnt all
there was to learn. They came to the village, they inquired for the Villa
Bidaud, they walked all round the walls, they lingered at the gate, they looked
up at the house, which, as you know, is not to be seen from any part of the
road, they talked together, they lingered still longer, and then--they went
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The King of France went up the hill,&quot; quoted Chaytor. &quot;Shall
I tell you what I make of all this?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The dream you had was of <i>your</i> enemies, not mine. These
three strangers are interested in you, and not, by any remote possibility, in
me. They inquired for the Villa Bidaud--<i>your</i> villa, <i>your</i> name. The
fact is, my friend, something you have forgotten in the past has been raked up
against you, and these three strangers have come to remind you of it.&quot; He
laughed in great enjoyment at this turning of the tables.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is an ingenious theory,&quot; said Gilbert, composedly.
&quot;Something I have forgotten in the past! But I have been so very, very careful.
Is it possible that anything can have escaped me? Perhaps, perhaps? We cannot be
for ever on our guard. Thank you for reminding me. You asked me if I was
frightened of thieves. Friend of my soul, I am frightened of everything, of
everybody. That is why I gave instructions that these gates were never to be
opened to strangers unless by my orders. None can gain admittance here against
my wish. It is a necessary precaution. Ah, here is my sister.&quot; He saluted her on
both cheeks, and then inquired for Annette.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She keeps her room,&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sick?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In temper only.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She knows of our return?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I informed her myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And her reply?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She will come down later.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert turned to Chaytor and said, &quot;Our little one has a will
and a temper of her own, but you will tame her; yes, you will tame her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor said nothing; he did not like the signs, and the
temptation came again upon him to fly. But still the image of Annette acted as a
counterpoise--her very avoidance of him made the prize more precious.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why did you not come to welcome us?&quot; he asked, when at length
she made her appearance.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was not well,&quot; she answered, with her eyes on the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you better now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is a nice lover's greeting,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">She shivered. He gazed frowningly at her, but she did not
raise her head. &quot;I will break her spirit,&quot; he thought.</p>

<p class="normal">Aloud he said, &quot;You do not seem happy, Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am most unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Am I the cause?&quot; he asked, and waited for the reply which did
not come. &quot;It is clear then; do you wish to break the contract?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can I?&quot; she said, with sudden eagerness.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; he answered, roughly. &quot;You are bound by the paper we
signed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This was her own belief. With a sigh she turned away, and
strove to fix her mind upon a book. But the words swam before her eyes; she
turned over page after page mechanically, without the least understanding of
their sense. All at once her attention was arrested by mention of a name--Old
Corrie. For some reason of his own, Gilbert Bidaud had directed the conversation
he was holding with Chaytor to the old Australian days, and he had just inquired
whether Chaytor could give him any information of Old Corrie. The old fellow's
visit to Emily's mother in Bournemouth had been made about the time that
Annette's feelings were undergoing a change towards the man to whom she had
engaged herself, as she believed, irrevocably. This would not have been a
sufficient cause for her not speaking of the visit to Chaytor, but he had
latterly expressed himself sick of Australia and all allusions to it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't speak of it again to me,&quot; he had said, pettishly, &quot;or
of anybody I knew there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She obeyed him, and thus it was that he was ignorant of
particulars, the knowledge of which would have saved him from tripping on the
present occasion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Corrie,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;the woodman? Oh, that old fool!&quot;
Annette started. The brutal tone in which Chaytor spoke shocked her. &quot;He's dead;
and a good riddance too.&quot; Annette covered her eyes with her hands. Old Corrie
was dead; he must have died lately--since his visit to Bournemouth. How strange
that the man who had just spoken had said nothing to her of the good old man's
death! She held her breath, and listened in amazement to what followed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dead, eh?&quot; said Gilbert, callously. &quot;Long since?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A good many years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In Australia, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course, in Australia.&quot; Gilbert would have dropped the
subject, as being of small interest; but, observing that Annette was listening
to the conversation with somewhat unusual attention, was impelled to say
something more upon it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did he leave any money behind him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not a shilling. Drank it all away. He died in a fit of
delirium tremens.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Annette rose from her chair in horror.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You saw him dead?&quot; pursued Gilbert, maliciously.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was with him at the time. You are mighty particular with
your questions.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was not aware that Annette had slowly approached him, and
was only made conscious of it by the touch of her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">She looked steadily at him; every vestige of colour had fled
from her face, her eyes dilated, her lips were apart; thus they gazed at each
other in silence, and Gilbert, leaning back in his chair, watched them closely.
There was an accusing quality in Annette's steady gaze which fascinated Chaytor,
and the colour died out of his face as it had died out of hers. His eyes began
to shift, his limbs to twitch.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How is this going to end?&quot; thought Gilbert Bidaud, his
interest in the scene growing. &quot;My niece has the upper hand here. Faith, she has
the Bidaud blood in her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His suddenly-aroused pride in her was a personal tribute to
himself. For fully five minutes there was dead silence in the room; then Annette
removed her hand from Chaytor's arm, and quitted the apartment.</p>

<p class="normal">The spell broken, Chaytor jumped up in fury, and looked after
her retreating form. Turning to Gilbert, he cried:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The girl has lost her senses. Is there insanity in your
family, M. Gilbert Bidaud?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We were ever remarkable,&quot; replied Gilbert, in a more serious
tone than that in which he generally spoke, &quot;for well-balanced brains. It is
that which has kept us always on the safe side, which has enabled us to swim
while others sink. Instead of losing her senses, Annette, perhaps, has come to
them. I give you my honest word, there crept into my mind, while you were
playing that silent scene with her, a profound admiration for the young lady, my
niece. She has qualities of the Bidaud type; I pay her tribute.&quot; He bowed
towards the door, half mockingly, half admiringly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't want your honest word,&quot; cried Chaytor in wrath and
fear, for it dawned upon him that the ally upon whom he reckoned might declare
himself against him. &quot;I want your plain meaning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You shall have it,&quot; said Gilbert; &quot;but as walls have ears,
and there may be danger--to you and not to me--in what you force me to say, I
propose that we adjourn to the lodge by the gates, where we may exchange
confidences in safety.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He led the way to the grounds, and Chaytor followed him, as a
whipped dog follows its master.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_42" href="#div1Ref_42">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">The lodge to which Gilbert Bidaud referred stood close to the
gates through which entrance was obtained to the house and grounds. It contained
four rooms, two above and two below, and was furnished for residence. There were
times when Gilbert himself occupied it, and it was always kept ready for him,
the two rooms below affording him all the accommodation he required. Between
these two rooms ran a narrow passage, at the back end of which was a door, but
seldom used, leading out to the grounds. A staircase at the side of this passage
led to the rooms above.</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud and Newman Chaytor had arrived at the villa
late in the day, and it was now night. Dark clouds had gathered, obscuring moon
and stars.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There will be a storm before sunrise,&quot; said Gilbert, as they
reached the front door of the lodge, which he unlocked and threw open. &quot;Enter,
my dear friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor uttered no word, and followed Gilbert into the
passage. The old man carefully locked the door, and the two men stood in
darkness a moment, listening. Then the master of Villa Bidaud turned the handle
of the door of the sitting-room, and stepping towards the window, closed the
shutters through which no chink of light could be seen from without. Having thus
secured themselves from observation, he struck a match and lit a lamp, which
threw a bright light around. In a basket by the sideboard were some bottles of
red wine, and glasses and corkscrew were handy. Gilbert uncorked a bottle and
put glasses on the table.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you drink?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you nothing stronger than this stuff?&quot; asked Chaytor, in
reply.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is a bottle of brandy somewhere,&quot; said Gilbert, opening
a door in the sideboard. &quot;Ah, here it is. I am glad that am able to accommodate
you. I am always glad to accommodate my friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor half filled a tumbler with the spirit, and drank it
neat. His companion took the bottle, and replaced it in the cupboard.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are a generous host,&quot; observed Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is not that,&quot; said Gilbert, genially. &quot;It is that you need
your wits to understand my plain meaning. Will you sit or stand?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do as I please.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do so. Your pleasure is a law to me. Pardon me a moment's
consideration. I am debating by what name to address you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My name is Basil Whittingham, as you well know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How should I well know it? It is not my custom to accept men
as they present themselves. I judge for myself. Man is a study. I study him, and
each one who crosses my path and enters, for a time short or long, into my life,
affords me scope for observation and contemplation. As you have done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As I have done,&quot; said Chaytor, moodily.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As you have done,&quot; repeated Gilbert.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I suppose I may make one observation.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One! A dozen--a hundred. What you say shall be attentively
received. Be sure of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I recall,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;a conversation we had. You said you
would not pry into my secrets, and expressed a desire that I should not pry into
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I remember. I said also something about our cupboards with
their skeletons, and that each should keep his key.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes--and you concluded with these words: 'What I choose to
reveal, I reveal; as with you. Beyond that boundary we do not step.' I am
correct in the quotation, I think?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is freely admitted. You have a retentive memory, and my
observations must have made an impression upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;attempted to pry into your
secrets. Why do you attempt to pry into mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear friend,&quot; said Gilbert, in his blandest tone, &quot;you
forget. It is by your invitation we are now conversing, and it is for your
safety I proposed we should converse here in secresy. You said to me, 'I want
your plain meaning.' If you have changed your mind, we will finish now, this
moment, and will return to our dear Annette.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Chaytor, &quot;we will not finish now. I will hear what
you have to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are gracious. But pray believe me; I have not attempted
to pry into your secrets. You have yourself revealed yourself to me by a
thousand signs. I am a man gifted with a fair intelligence. I do not say to my
mind, Observe, it observes intuitively, without command or direction. What is
the result? I learn, not what you are, but what you are not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed! And what am I not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Plainly?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite plainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear friend,&quot; said Gilbert Bidaud, with a smile and a
confident nod, &quot;you are not Basil Whittingham.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is your game, is it?&quot; cried Chaytor, but his heart was
chilled by the cold assurance of Gilbert's voice and manner.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not my game--yours. I did not intrude upon you; you intruded
upon me. By your own design you came, and if there is a pit before you, it is
you, not I, who have dug it. But you can yet save yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How?&quot; said Chaytor involuntarily, and was instantly made
aware of his imprudence by the amused smile which his exclamation called up to
Gilbert's lips. &quot;Curse it! I mean, what have I revealed, as you so cleverly
express it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will tell you. You come to Paris, and play the spy upon us.
You take rooms opposite our hotel, and so arrange a foreground of observation,
that you can see what passes in our apartments without dreaming that you have
laid yourself open to observation.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, you found that out, did you?&quot; exclaimed Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I found that out; and I found out also that you had been in
Paris a long, long time, although you declared to my niece, when you first
presented yourself to us, that you had but just arrived by the night train. I
take no merit for the discovery. You revealed it to me while you were driving
with your gay companions. I asked myself, 'Why this lie? Why this secret
espionage?' and since then it is that I found the answer. Naturally we spoke of
Australia; naturally I recalled the incidents of my first meeting with Basil
Whittingham on my brother's plantation. They were incidents it was not possible
to forget by either of us, and yet, dear friend, you were entirely ignorant of
them; indeed, you scoffed at me for inventing what never occurred. In this way
did you again reveal to me, not what you are, but what you are not. Finding your
memory so treacherous, I set a trap, frankly I confess it, a simple, innocent
trap, which you, being Basil Whittingham, would have stepped over without injury
to yourself. In that case it would have been I, not you, who would have had to
eat humble pie--is not that your English saying? I invented scenes and incidents
in our meeting and brief acquaintanceship in Australia to which you put your
seal. On my word, it was as good as a comedy, these imaginary conversations and
incidents of my conjuring up, and you saying, 'Yes, yes, I remember, I
remember.' Fie, fie, dear friend, it was clumsy of you. Again, those English
newspapers, with their celebrated case which you were so greedy to peruse. Your
explanation did not blind me. I knew why you bought and read them so eagerly.
There were here to my hand the pieces of a puzzle not difficult to put together.
Let me tell you--you deceived not one of us completely. My sister says, 'That
man is not Basil Whittingham.' My niece says no word--her grief is too
great--she suffers, through you, a martyrdom; but she doubts you none the less.
Some strong confirmation--I know not what--of her doubts you presented her with
this very night when you spoke so freely of Old Corrie's death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Curse you!&quot; cried Chaytor. &quot;You drew me on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Could I guess what was coming when his name was introduced?
Could I divine what you were about to say? Take this from me, my friend; my
niece knows something of Old Corrie which neither you nor I know, and when she
placed her hand on your arm, and looked into those eyes of yours which shifted
and wavered beneath her gaze, you felt as I felt, that she accused you of lying.
Even her maid, Emily, who never set eyes on Basil Whittingham, believes not in
you. And the fault is all your own. It is you, and you alone, who have supplied
the evidence against yourself. I see in your face an intention of blustering and
denying. Abandon it, dear friend. So far as we are concerned, the game is up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So you mean to say that you withdraw from the marriage
contract between me and Annette?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is not I who withdraw; it is she, who will choose death
rather. She may consider herself bound--I cannot say; but she and you will never
stand side by side at the altar.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The best thing I can do is to make myself scarce.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is, to disappear?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can express it in those words if you choose. Mind, I do
not leave your hospitable abode because I am afraid. What is there to be afraid
of? I can afford to laugh at what you have said, which is false from beginning
to end, but I am sick of your ways. You have done pretty well out of me; you are
a cunning old bird, and you have feathered your nest with my feathers. I
calculate that you have at least five thousand pounds of my money in your
pocket.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of your money?&quot; queried Gilbert, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of my money.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no; whatever else we do let us be truthful. Of Basil
Whittingham's money.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, you can stick to that fiction as long as you like. Have
you anything else to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. You are not free to go yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What! Will you stop me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; I will follow you, and will accuse you publicly. We will
have the case in the papers, and you shall have an opportunity of clearing
yourself of the accusation I bring against you. Basil Whittingham maybe alive;
Old Corrie may be alive; people who know really who you are may be alive, and
they shall all be found to be brought forward to acquit or condemn you. If you
want noise, fuss, publicity, you shall have them. There is, however, an
alternative.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not being Basil Whittingham, you have committed forgery by
affixing his name to two documents in my possession. Not being Basil
Whittingham, you have obtained by fraud the fortune which was his. So
apprehensive of detection are you, that you would not deposit this money in a
bank, as a right-minded gentleman would have done, but you carry it about with
you, in secret pockets, on your person.&quot; Chaytor started. &quot;I could put my finger
on the precise spots in which Basil Whittingham's fortune is concealed. It is
again you, dear friend, who have revealed this to me. You have a habit of
raising your hand--you are doing it unconsciously at this moment--to your side,
to your breast, to assure yourself that the money is safe. Shall we make terms?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Name them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not desire to know the amount of your wealth; I think
only of myself, and of what the secret in my possession is worth. Shall we say
five thousand pounds?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You may say five thousand pounds,&quot; blustered Chaytor, and
then suddenly paused, overwhelmed by the sense of power in his companion's
smiling face. &quot;Hang it,&quot; he said presently, &quot;give me some brandy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Gilbert Bidaud produced the bottle, and, as Newman Chaytor
gulped the liquor down, repeated, &quot;Shall we say five thousand pounds?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will give you one,&quot; said Chaytor faintly. &quot;Five. Decide
quickly. Observe, I take out my watch; it wants two minutes to the hour. If at
the end of these two minutes you do not agree, I shall double the terms. By this
time you know me, and know that you cannot with safety trifle with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor stepped forward and looked at the second-hand, his
mind dazed with whirling thought. Should he refuse? Should he show fight? Did he
dare to risk the exposure which Gilbert threatened?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It wants thirty seconds yet,&quot; said Gilbert, calmly? &quot;they are
precious moments, these that are flying so fast? Twenty--fifteen--ten--five----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I consent to be robbed,&quot; said Chaytor, hurriedly. He did not
dare to fight.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good,&quot; said Gilbert, putting the watch back in his pocket.
&quot;The bargain must be completed to-night, after which without loss of time, I
should advise you to disappear. I will make excuses to my niece; she will not be
anxious to see your face again. Nor shall I. At midnight, here, we will meet
again, for the last time, and after you have purchased safety we will bid each
other an eternal farewell. I will have a horse ready for you, on which you can
ride to--where you please. Let us now return to the bosom of my beloved family;
a longer absence may arouse suspicion.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_43" href="#div1Ref_43">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">During the visit of Gilbert and Chaytor to Monte Carlo some
important action had been taken by Annette's staunch maid, Emily. Loyal to the
backbone to her young mistress, she had fully sympathised with her in her
unhappiness, and had gone farther than Annette, in her reflections upon the
future. She saw that a marriage with a man to whom Annette had pledged herself
would result in lifelong misery, and she set her mind to work to consider how
the dreadful consequence could be averted. She saw but one way to accomplish
this; she and her mistress must fly from the Villa Bidaud. She did not moot this
project to Annette, for whenever she commenced to speak upon the subject of the
approaching union Annette stopped her, and would not listen to what she had to
say. &quot;But at the last moment,&quot; thought the faithful maid, &quot;when she sees that
there is no other escape for her, she will agree to fly with me from this
horrible place. We will go to mother in Bournemouth; she will be safer there
than in these wicked foreign countries.&quot; Having reached thus far in her
deliberations she did not pursue them farther; she was not an argumentative
person, and she was comfortably satisfied with the general reflection that,
after that, things would be sure to come all right. Such a belief is common with
numbers of worthy people when they are considering knotty questions, and if it
evidences no deep powers of mental analysis, is at all events a proof of the
possession of an inherent dependence upon the goodness of Providence--which, in
its way, is a kind of religion not to be despised.</p>

<p class="normal">With a certain conclusion in her mind, Annette busied herself
as to the means of carrying it out when the proper time arrived. By Gilbert
Bidaud's orders the gates were kept locked, and the duty of opening them
devolved upon a man who did all the outdoor work in the house and grounds.
Emily's advances towards this man met with no response; other means, therefore,
must be tried. She had always been successful in making friends outside Gilbert
Bidaud's establishment, through whom she obtained her letters from home, and the
friend she had made in the village in which the Villa Bidaud was situated was
the woman who kept the post-house. It was a matter easily arranged. Annette was
a liberal mistress, and Emily was a saving girl; a judicious system of small
bribes effected all that Emily desired in this respect. Twice or thrice every
week she visited the post-mistress to enquire for letters, and these visits were
made in the night, the darkest hours being chosen. The gates being locked she
could not get out that way, and she sought another mode of egress. She found it
in the lodge in which Gilbert Bidaud and Newman Chaytor held their conference.
There was a secure lock on the front door, of which Gilbert, or his sister, kept
the key, but the lock on the back door was frail, and Emily discovered how to
manage it, so that she could get in and out of the lodge without any person
being the wiser. Once inside the lodge Emily would creep up the stairs to the
first floor, the window of the back room of which almost touched the stone wall
which ran round the grounds. This wall was some seven feet in height, but there
were dilapidations in it which served for foot-holes, and by means of these
luckily-formed steps the courageous girl was enabled to pass to and fro and make
the desired visits to the post-mistress. Of course there was the danger of
discovery, but Emily was a girl in a thousand, and the extraordinary care she
took in these enterprises was a fair guarantee of safety. The lonely situation
of the house assisted her; there were nights when, for hours together, not a
human being traversed the narrow road into which the front gate opened.</p>

<p class="normal">On the night of the secret interview between Gilbert and
Chaytor, Emily had planned a visit to the post-mistress. She made her way into
the lodge unobserved, crept up the stairs in the dark, and was about to open the
back window, when her attention was arrested by a sound below, which, as she
afterwards described, sent her heart into her mouth. It was the sound of the
unlocking of the front door. Emily's heart went rub-a-dub with the fear that she
was discovered, but as the slow minutes passed without anything occurring, her
fear lessened, and she became sufficiently composed to give attention to the
circumstances. Softly opening the door which led to the staircase, she heard
voices in a room below which she recognised as those of Gilbert Bidaud and the
man who called himself Basil Whittingham. What had they come there to say? Why
could they not have spoken in the house? They must be hatching some plot against
her young mistress. At all hazards, she would try to hear what they were saying
to each other. Quietly, very quietly, she descended the stairs, setting her feet
down with the greatest care, and pausing between each step. A cat could not have
trod more noiselessly than she. At length she reached the door beyond which the
conversation was taking place, and crouching down she applied her eye to the
keyhole. There were the two men, one with a smile on his face, the other, dark
and sinister; and Emily observed that they were not standing side by side, but
that a broad table was between them. This precaution had been taken by Gilbert,
who was quite prepared for any sudden attempt at violence on Chaytor's part.</p>

<p class="normal">Emily was too late to hear all that was said, but she heard
enough. Had she not exercised control over her feelings she would have screamed
with mingled joy and horror; as it was, the tears ran down her face as fast as
she wiped them away, for she wanted to see as much as she could. The brave girl
thanked God that a fortunate conjuncture had made her a witness of the interview
between the two villains. Now, certainly, her dear mistress was saved, and she
the instrument to avert the misery with which she was threatened; for it was not
alone the projected marriage which was breaking Annette's heart, but the loss of
faith in the purity and nobility of Basil's nature. Emily waited very nearly to
the end; she saw Gilbert take out his watch and count the moments, she heard the
bargain agreed to and the second interview at midnight planned, and then, just
in time, she crept up the stairs as softly as she had crept down, and waited in
the room above until the two men left the lodge.</p>

<p class="normal">What now should she do? Return to the house, and acquaint
Annette with what she had heard, or go to the post-mistress to see if there was
a letter for her? If she went straight to Annette she might not have another
opportunity of getting out that night; besides, she expected a letter from her
mother, and was anxious for it. She decided to go first to the post-mistress;
Annette knew that she would be away for some little while, and had said, &quot;I
shall wait up for you, Emily.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She threw open the window, and climbed on to the wall, and
down into the road. It was very dark, and as Gilbert Bidaud had prognosticated,
a storm was gathering, but Emily knew her way well to the post-office, and was
not afraid of darkness. So she sped along under the waving branches and over
black shadows till she arrived at her destination. Once on her way she was
startled; she thought she saw something more substantial than shadow moving by
the road side, but after pausing to look and listen her alarm subsided; all was
quiet and still.</p>

<p class="normal">There was no light in the post-house, which was little better
than a cottage, but Emily did not expect to see one. She tapped at the shutters,
and a woman's voice from within asked if that was &quot;Miss Emily.&quot; The girl
answering in the affirmative, a woman appeared at the door and bade her enter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you a letter for me?&quot; said Emily.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; the woman replied, &quot;she had a letter for her,&quot; and
produced it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why,&quot; cried Emily, &quot;this is not from England?&quot; No, said the
woman, it was not from England, and explained that a gentleman had visited her
in the evening, and had made enquiries concerning the Villa Bidaud and its
inmates. Hearing that Miss Annette Bidaud was there, he had then inquired for
the young lady's maid, mentioning her by name, Miss Emily Crawford. The
gentleman asked if the post-mistress was likely to see the girl, and whether she
could convey a letter to her secretly that night or early in the morning. The
post-mistress said she could not promise to do so that night, but she would
endeavour to convey the letter in the morning, and added that it was not
unlikely Miss Emily would come before them to inquire for letters. &quot;If she
does,&quot; said the gentleman, &quot;give her this, and ask her to read it here, before
she goes back to the villa. It is a letter of the utmost importance, and it must
fall into no other hands than Miss Emily's.&quot; The post-mistress concluded by
saying that the gentleman had paid her well for the service, and that she was
sure there was something very particular in the letter.</p>

<p class="normal">Emily, although burning with impatience, listened quietly to
the tale, holding the letter tight in her hand all the time, and when the woman
had done speaking asked only one question.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was the gentleman an Englishman?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the woman; &quot;he was an Englishman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then Emily opened the letter, and read:</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;<span class="sc">My Dear Miss Emily Crawford,</span>,--The
writer of this is Old Corrie, Miss Annette's sincere and faithful friend. He has
seen your mother in Bournemouth, and has come here post haste to defeat a plot
to ruin your dear young mistress's happiness. He has a gentleman with him little
lady will be glad to see. If you get this letter to-night, don't be frightened
if Old Corrie speaks to you as you go back to the Villa Bidaud. Not an hour
should be lost to unmask the villain and secure little lady's happiness. You are
a brave, good girl. If you don't get this letter till the morning, come at once
to the back of the school-house, where you will see little lady's true friend,</p>

<p style="text-indent:60%">&quot;<span class="sc">Old Corrie</span>.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">The letter had been composed partly by Basil and partly by Old
Corrie, who had written it himself. Emily's eyes sparkled as she read. She bade
the post-mistress good-night, thanked her for the letter, said it contained good
news, and went away with a heart as light as a bird's. So light, indeed, that
she carolled softly to herself as she stepped very, very slowly along the dark,
narrow road, and the words she carolled were:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am Emily Crawford, and I have got your letter. Where are
you, dear Old Corrie, dear Old Corrie, dear Old Corrie?&quot; The song could not have
been put into lines that would scan, but blither, happier words with true poetry
in them, were never sung by human voice.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where are you, dear Old Corrie, dear Old Corrie, dear Old
Corrie?&quot; sang the girl, and paused and listened, and went on again, singing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here I am,&quot; said a kindly voice, &quot;and God bless you for a
true heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Stop a moment, please,&quot; said the girl; who now that the
reality was close by her side, could not help feeling startled. &quot;Are you sure
you are Old Corrie, my dear mistress's friend from Australia? The gentleman with
a bear, you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do well to doubt,&quot; said Old Corrie, &quot;with what is going
on around you in this outlandish country. I am the man I say. Stand still while
I strike a light, so that you can see me. We have a bull's-eye lantern with us.
Is little lady well?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Her heart is breaking,&quot; said Emily. &quot;But I have good news for
her before she sleeps to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And so have we, my dear, if you can get us to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me hold the lantern, Mr. Corrie, said Emily.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, my dear, you might drop it; there is a surprise in store
for you and for everyone in the villa yonder with its stone walls. There, the
lamp's alight, and you can see my face, dark as the night is. Do you think you
can trust me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I do, and it was only out of curiosity I wanted to look
at you.&quot; And then Emily cried, &quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it, my dear?&quot; asked Old Corrie.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is another,&quot; said Emily, gasping.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There are two others; we have come prepared.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He whispered something in her ear which caused her to cry
&quot;Oh!&quot; more than once, and to clap her hands in wonderment.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;May I see him?&quot; she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class="normal">The answer was given by Basil himself, who came forward and
took her by the hand, while the light, directed by Old Corrie, shone upon his
face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is wonderful, wonderful!&quot; she exclaimed, and added under
her breath, &quot;But I think I should have known.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In the expression of which opinion she paid a higher tribute
to her judgment than she could have rightly claimed for it; but this, at such a
time and in such circumstances, was a small matter.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Philpott, who had been standing silently in the rear, now
joined the party.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't be frightened, my dear,&quot; said Old Corrie; &quot;there are no
more of us. What we've got to do now is to decide what is to be done, how is it
to be done, and when is it to be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;First,&quot; interposed Mr. Philpott, to whom, by tacit consent,
the command had been given, &quot;Miss Emily will perhaps give us an explanation of
certain words she spoke a minute ago. Are we quite private here, Miss Emily?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's hardly likely,&quot; replied Emily, &quot;that a living soul will
pass along this road till daybreak.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So much the better. You said just now that Miss Bidaud's
heart was breaking, but that you had good news for her before she went to sleep
to-night. Did you mean by that that our arrival here was the good news?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I meant something very different, something that you
ought to know before you decide what to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought as much. Well, let us hear it, my girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Thereupon Emily related all that she had overheard between
Gilbert Bidaud and Newman Chaytor. It was difficult for Basil to curb his
excitement, and whenever an indignant exclamation passed his lips, Emily paused
in sympathy, but he was too sensible of the value of time to frequently
interrupt her, and as she spoke quickly, her tale did not occupy many minutes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This story,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, with a beaming face, &quot;decides
what is to be done, and how and when. The road is prepared for us by the
villains themselves. It is a bold move I am about to suggest, but to adopt
half-and-half measures with these scoundrels would be ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Basil and Old Corrie said they were prepared for any move,
however bold and daring, and were only too eager to undertake it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We mustn't be to eager,&quot; said Mr. Philpott; &quot;cool and steady
is our watchword. Now, Miss Emily, can you get us into the grounds of the villa
to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I can get in,&quot; said the girl, &quot;you can get in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And one of us into the lodge where the scoundrels are to meet
at midnight?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Emily, unhesitatingly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are a girl after my own heart,&quot; said Mr. Philpott,
admiringly. &quot;There is a risk, you know, and you will have a share in it. It
wouldn't be right for me to deceive you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't mind the risk,&quot; said the courageous girl. &quot;I want to
help to save my dear young lady from these wretches and monsters.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;God bless you, Emily,&quot; said Basil, pressing her hand, and
Emily felt that she needed no other reward.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Philpott then described his plan. Guided by Emily, they
were all to get into the grounds, when their forces were to be thus disposed of:
Basil and Old Corrie were to hide in the grounds as close as possible to the
back door of the lodge; they were not to move or speak; Emily was to return to
the house, and impart to Annette all that she knew, and in this way prepare her
for what was to follow; both Annette and her maid were to be ready to come from
the house to the lodge upon a given signal; Mr. Philpott was to conceal himself
in one of the upper rooms of the lodge, and no movement whatever was to be made
until he blew loudly upon a policeman's whistle. The moment this signal was
given, Basil and Old Corrie were to enter the lodge through the back door, which
Emily would leave unlocked, but properly closed, so as to excite no suspicion in
the minds of Gilbert Bidaud and Newman Chaytor--and proceed at once to the lower
room, in which these men were located; and Annette and Emily were to leave the
house and come immediately to the lodge.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All this,&quot; said Mr. Philpott aside to Basil, &quot;is not exactly
lawful, and if Mr. Bidaud and Mr. Chaytor had right on their side we should get
into trouble. But we have the whip hand of them and are safe. I anticipate very
little difficulty, only neither of our men must be allowed to escape until we
have settled with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The party proceeded to the villa, Emily walking a little ahead
with Basil, to whom she imparted how matters stood with her young mistress.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Her heart was truly breaking,&quot; said the girl, &quot;and she could
never have lived through it, never! But she will soon be her dear, bright self
again. All, sir, she is the sweetest lady that ever drew breath--and O, how
these wretches have made her suffer! But there is happiness coming to her. I
could sing for joy, indeed I could, sir!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_44" href="#div1Ref_44">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h4>
<br>

<p class="normal">All was still in house and grounds and lodge. The dark clouds
were growing black, but the storm had not yet burst. A clock in the hall struck
twelve, and, as if the chimes had called them forth, Gilbert and Chaytor issued
from the house, and walked to their rendezvous. Each man was occupied with his
own special thoughts, and each kept a wary eye upon the other's shadowed form.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I left the door of the lodge open,&quot; said Gilbert. &quot;Enter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;After you,&quot; said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; said Gilbert, &quot;after you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor laughed and stepped into the passage. Gilbert
followed, pausing to light a small lamp he carried in his hand. Upon entering
the room he lit the larger lamp on the table, on one side of which he placed
himself, Chaytor being on the other.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You seem to be afraid of me,&quot; said Chaytor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not trust you,&quot; responded Gilbert.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is small temptation for trustfulness between such men
as we,&quot; said Chaytor. Gilbert nodded quietly. &quot;Well, you have your game, and
have won a pretty large stake. Can't you be satisfied with what you have got?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know my terms; the time for discussing them has gone by.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But there was something forgotten. You made me sign two
documents, and you have spoken of forgery.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are correct. The production of these documents with the
name of Basil Whittingham attached to them in your handwriting would be
sufficient to convict you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For that reason I do not choose to leave them in your
possession. If I pay you the five thousand pounds you are robbing me of you will
have to give them up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They are here,&quot; said Gilbert, producing them, &quot;and will be
useless to me when you are gone. You can have them and welcome when the money is
paid. You go to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I go to-night, and hope never to set eyes upon you or yours
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear friend,&quot; said Gilbert, with a courteous bow, &quot;the
hope is reciprocal. Let us not prolong this interview. Open your bank and
purchase freedom.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Chaytor unbuttoned his waistcoat, and from an inner pocket
extracted two bundles of bank notes. Gilbert held out his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no, old fox,&quot; said Chaytor. &quot;There are three times five
thousand pounds here.&quot; He looked at Gilbert savagely.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; said the old man, laughing lightly, &quot;by a wish you could
burn me to ashes where I stand, you would breathe that wish willingly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Most willingly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But why? I am dealing tenderly, mercifully by you. In right
and justice this money belongs not to you. It belongs to Basil Whittingham. If
he were here he could take possession of it, and neither you nor I would care to
gainsay him. It being, therefore, as much mine as yours, I let you off lightly
by demanding so small a sum. Come, let us finish the comedy; it is time the
curtain fell. Count out the price of liberty, the price of my silence, and let
us take an affectionate farewell of each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you sure we are alone?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you think I would reveal our conspiracy to a third person?
In my pleasant house every human being is asleep; they dream not of the grief
which will fill their hearts to-morrow when they learn that you have departed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give me the papers I have signed. Here is your share of the
robbery. You had better count it to make sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As Gilbert bent over the table to count the notes, Chaytor,
with a swift movement, drew a heavy life-preserver from his breast, and aimed a
murderous blow at the old man's head. But Gilbert was too quick for him; he had
but one eye on the money he was fingering, the other was furtively watching his
companion. He darted back, and so escaped the blow; the weapon descended upon
the table, and this shock and the violent movements of the men overturned the
lamps, the light of which was instantly extinguished. Each man had but one hand
disengaged, Chaytor holding the life-preserver and Gilbert a pistol, which he
had brought with him as a protection against treachery. The moment the room was
in darkness the two disengaged hands groped over the table for the money, and
were fiercely clasped. And now a surprising incident occurred. Upon these two
hands a third hand was laid, and before they could free themselves were
handcuffed together. Simultaneously with this startling and secure manacling of
their hands the pistol was knocked from Gilbert's grasp and the life-preserver
from Chaytor's; and then a shrill whistle pierced the air and drove the blood
from the cheeks of the conspirators. Hurried sounds of steps resounded through
the passage.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This way!&quot; cried Mr. Philpott. &quot;The door is open. Strike a
light.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But a light came from another quarter. A vivid flash of
lightning illuminated the apartment, and in that flash Newman Chaytor beheld the
form of Basil Whittingham, whose death he believed he had compassed on the gold
field across the seas. His face grew livid, a heavy groan escaped his lips, and
his head fell forward on the table.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;See if you can relight one of the lamps,&quot; said Mr. Philpott.</p>

<p class="normal">Both the lamps were soon lighted, the glass of only one having
been broken. Then Gilbert Bidaud, who had uttered no word during this succession
of startling incidents, saw two men whose faces were strange to him, and one
whose face he recognised. Manacled as he was to his insensible partner in crime,
and unable to release himself, he instantly regained his self-possession.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I mistake not,&quot; he said, in a tone of exceeding urbanity,
&quot;Mr. Basil Whittingham, whose acquaintance I had the pleasure of making on my
brother's plantation in Australia. I suspected from the first that this log
lying here was an impostor. It is but a sorry welcome I am able to give you, in
consequence of the unlawful proceedings of a ruffian&quot;--he glanced at Mr.
Philpott--&quot;who shall answer for the assault in a court of law.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do not say one word to him, sir,&quot; interposed Mr. Philpott,
seeing that Basil was about to speak; &quot;leave him to me; I know how to deal with
such cattle. I promise to tame him before I have done with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will be well for you to bear in mind,&quot; said Gilbert, still
addressing Basil, &quot;that this is my house, and that you are trespassing illegally
upon my property. However, for the sake of old times, and for the sake of my
niece, I am agreeable to waive that, and come to an amicable settlement with
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He speaks very good English for a foreigner,&quot; said Mr.
Philpott, &quot;and, I'll wager, understands the law as well as we do. I am an
officer of the law&quot;--(Mr. Philpott was satisfied that he was quite safe in
indulging in this fiction)--&quot;and I tell him plainly that he as laid himself open
to a criminal action for conspiracy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shall I not have the pleasure,&quot; said Gilbert to Basil,
ignoring Mr. Philpott, &quot;of hearing what you have to say in response to the flag
of peace I hold out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is a shrewd customer, sir,&quot; said Mr. Philpott, &quot;and if
this flag of peace means absolute and unconditional surrender I am ready to
consider it. It may interest him to learn that we are in possession of all the
particulars of the interview which took place between him and the insensible
party he is fastened to, and of the bargain they made to share your money. That
tickles him, I see, but it is only one out of a handful of trumps we happen to
hold. I will take care of these notes&quot;--he gathered them up--&quot;and we will go
into accounts later on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Unless my ears deceive me,&quot; said Gilbert, &quot;I hear the voice
of my niece's maid in the passage. Doubtless my niece accompanies her. Do you
think it seemly that she shall be a witness of this scene?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Corrie,&quot; said Basil, &quot;take one of the lamps, and keep Miss
Bidaud outside; I will come to her immediately. Allow me, Mr. Philpott; it will
shorten matters if I say a word.&quot; He addressed Gilbert Bidaud. &quot;You and your
confederate have laid yourselves open to serious consequences, and if I consent
to an arrangement which will keep the bad work that has been going on, and of
which I was made the victim, from exposure in the public courts, it is to spare
the feelings of a sweet and suffering young lady whose happiness you would have
wrecked.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My niece,&quot; said Gilbert, nodding his head. &quot;As you say, a
sweet young lady, and she has been made to suffer by this villain. We have all
been made to suffer; we have all been his victims. But for your arrival he would
have murdered me. He can no longer impose on me; I arrange myself on your side,
against him. To my regret I perceive that he has partially recovered his senses,
and, while simulating insensibility, is listening to what we are saying; his
cunning is of the lowest order. It is my earnest wish to make such an
arrangement as you suggest; it will be to my advantage, that is why I agree.
Instruct your man to release me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Set him loose, Mr. Philpott,&quot; said Basil, &quot;and see what you
can do. I put the matter unreservedly into your hands. Do not allow either of
them to leave the room. They will pass the night here. To-morrow, if Miss Bidaud
wishes it, she will quit this prison----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no,&quot; interrupted Gilbert, good-humouredly, &quot;not a
prison--not a prison.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;--For England.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She shall have my free consent,&quot; said Gilbert. &quot;Take that in
writing, Mr. Philpott. And there must be restitution, in some part, of the
inheritance her father left her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In some part, that shall be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If it is any punishment to the wretch,&quot; said Basil, who saw
that Newman Chaytor was conscious and attentive, &quot;who conspired against the man
who trusted in him, and treacherously endeavoured to compass his death, to learn
that had he followed the straight road he would have known long since that his
unhappy father died wealthy, let him learn it now. You have a copy, Mr.
Philpott, of the last letter written to him by his father. Give it to him, that
he may read the bitter words written on the death-bed of one whom he should have
loved and honoured. His good mother died with her head upon my breast, and if he
escapes the punishment he deserves and has richly earned, he will owe his escape
to the kind memories I have of her who rescued me from death in the London
streets.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A noble man,&quot; murmured Gilbert Bidaud as Basil left the room,
&quot;A gentleman. How is it possible that I allowed myself to be deceived for an
hour by so miserable a counterfeit!&quot;</p>

<br>
<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">When Basil joined his friends in the passage, Old Corrie
touched Emily's arm, and slight as was the action, she understood it, and
following him into the room in which Mr. Philpott and the two men they had
surprised were conferring, left Basil and Annette together. Old Corrie had
placed the lamp on a bracket, and by its dim light our hero and heroine were
enabled to see each other. Basil's eyes were fixed earnestly upon Annette, but
her agitation was too profound to meet his loving gaze. His heart was filled
with pity for the faithful girl who had been for years the victim of Newman
Chaytor's foul plot; her drooping head, her modest attitude, her hands clasped
supplicatingly before her, made his pity and his love for her almost too painful
to bear.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Annette,&quot; he said softly, &quot;will you not look at me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She raised her eyes to his face, and he saw that they were
filled with tears.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can you forgive me, Basil?&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Forgive you, dear Annette!&quot; he exclaimed, taking her hands in
his, &quot;it is I who ought to ask forgiveness for believing that you could forget
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never for a single day,&quot; she murmured, &quot;have I forgotten you.
Through all these years you have been to me the star of hope which made life
bright for me. Oh, Basil, Basil! it seems as if you have lifted me from death to
life. The world was so dark, so dark-----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be dark no more dear,&quot; he said, his voice trembling
with excess of tenderness. &quot;Until you bid me leave you I will be ever by your
side. I consecrate my life to you. What man can do to compensate for the
suffering you have endured, that will I do in truth, and honour, and love.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He placed his arms about her, and she laid her head upon his
breast. There are joys too sacred for utterance, and such joy did Basil and
Annette feel as they stood clasped in each other's arms on that dark and solemn
night.</p>

<br>
<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">What more need be told? Radiant and happy, with faith
restored, they commenced their new life hand-in-hand. Those who had conspired
against them, and whose evil designs had been frustrated, went out into the
world unpunished by man; they and their intended victims never met again. The
business matters it was necessary to arrange were settled by Basil's lawyers,
who saved from the wreck a sufficient competence. All who had served him and
Annette were amply rewarded. In Mr. Philpott's family their names were names to
conjure with; Emily remained with them till she found a sweetheart and a home of
her own; and Old Corrie was prevailed upon to live in a cottage near them,
attached to which was a piece of land which afforded him profitable employment.
He talked sometimes of returning to Australia, or of buying another performing
bear, but he did not carry either project into execution. Often and often would
the three friends talk of the old days on the plantation, and call up
reminiscences of the happy and primitive life they enjoyed there; and then Old
Corrie would steal away and leave the lovers together; for, though they were man
and wife, they were lovers still, and lovers will remain--purified and sweetened
by their trials--till they are called to their rest.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
